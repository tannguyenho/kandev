"""Isolate the Inbox History read path from operational sinks and UI state.

AC-UI-INBOX-HISTORY-001.5/.17/.22 need two, opposite-direction halves of one
rule:

- The SINK half (AC .5): a closed set of backend files that must never
  reference the history read's exported entry points, because the read
  shares a package with most of its own sinks and there is no import
  statement to forbid within one Go package.
- The SOURCE half (AC .17/.22): the history modules themselves must never
  reference the sidebar/Needs-you count state or an event-stream
  subscription entry point, so History can never (even accidentally) feed
  the sidebar badge or start reacting to live updates.

Both sets and both forbidden-target lists are enumerated explicitly rather
than inferred from a substring match on "history" or "count" -- per the
system design's "The rule's own module shall enumerate all of them rather
than infer them from a substring match", and AC .16 requires the History
tab to render its own bundle count, so the bare identifier "count" can never
be a forbidden target.

Matching is a raw source-text scan (see _find_all below), so it also matches
a forbidden target's name inside a comment, not just live code. Do not name
a forbidden target in an explanatory comment in a history source file --
there is no way to except it short of removing the comment.
