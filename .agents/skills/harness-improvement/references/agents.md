# Single-Session Policy

Kandev intentionally has no project-local custom-agent files for planning or
implementation. The durable workflow uses the user-started primary conversation
so model choice, transcript, and cost remain visible and predictable. The only
repository-defined exception is the read-only `pr-poller` waiting aid.
Platform-provided explorers and other harness-managed investigation agents are
not prohibited by this policy.

## Default Workflow

1. Use a strong model for discovery, requirements, system designs, plans, work
   orders, and high-risk decisions.
2. At the completed-plan checkpoint, return control with a concise handoff. Do
   not call `ask_user_question_kandev` or ask the user to approve the package or
   switch models. The user reviews the artifacts, changes the model if desired,
   and sends a later explicit implementation request.
3. Execute work orders sequentially by default. Plans may label parallel-safe
   waves, but launch native subagents only after the user explicitly asks.
4. Ask the user to switch back to a strong model only for an architectural,
   public-contract, persistence, or high-impact security decision.

Do not create `.agents/agents`, `.codex/agents`, `.claude/agents`,
`.cursor/agents`, or `.opencode/agents` files merely to route model tiers.
The durable requirements, system designs, plans, and work orders are the
model-switch handoff. A work order is the compact native-subagent packet when
the user authorizes delegation.

For planned implementation, the user explicitly authorizes native subagents.
Use the model active in the selected primary session, use no full-history fork,
and confirm routing from runtime usage metadata. Do not infer authorization from
a plan's waves.

## Exception

The `pr-poller` is allowed only when the user explicitly asks the primary
conversation to wait for or monitor a PR. It is read-only, time-bounded, and
cannot edit, comment, resolve threads, or spawn children.

Create any other custom agent only when the user explicitly requests one and
accepts its additional context and coordination cost. Native subagents explicitly
authorized for a plan do not require custom-agent files. For a custom agent,
read only the relevant `platforms/<platform>.md` reference and state the
affected model, reasoning, isolation, and cost trade-off before editing.
