# Harness Validation

Use this reference for the shared checks after changing skills, agents,
references, or always-on instruction files.

```bash
python3 scripts/lint-harness-files.test.py
python3 .github/scripts/lint-harness-files.py --all
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.test.py
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
git diff --check -- <changed-files>
wc -l -w -c <changed-harness-files>
```

Before committing, also run the targeted pre-commit hook:

```bash
pre-commit run harness-lint --files <changed-files>
```

Keep every `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` file at 300 lines or fewer. Move detail
to the nearest scoped file or a referenced document when a parent reaches the
limit.

Compare word and byte counts with the previous version. If the common workflow
grows, remove duplicate rules or move conditional detail into linked references.
Line limits do not measure reading cost.
