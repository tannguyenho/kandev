# Session Learnings

Use this when the user asks for "session learnings", "harness improvements", "worth recording", or feeds feedback from another agent.

## Convert Feedback Into A Durable Change

For each learning, extract:

- **Trigger:** when future agents should apply it.
- **Failure mode:** what went wrong or wasted time.
- **Evidence:** the observed command, assertion, log, or source that supports
  the lesson. Keep source task/PR links in the collection record.
- **Applicability:** the conditions where the lesson holds and known exceptions.
- **Correct action:** exact behavior, command, fallback, or interpretation.
- **Verification:** how an agent knows the workaround succeeded.
- **Home:** skill, agent, script, AGENTS.md, or command.
- **Existing guidance:** the rule this lesson replaces or strengthens.

Keep unverified explanations in the collection record as hypotheses.
Before promotion, verify the explanation against current code or authoritative
documentation. One verified incident can justify a narrowly scoped rule.
Do not turn its workaround into a universal requirement without supporting evidence.
Keep session history in the collection record and reusable instructions in the
owning skill or scoped guidance. Encode deterministic checks in scripts and tests.

Prefer this shape inside skills:

```md
If <condition>, do <action>. Why: <short reason>. Verify with <command/output>.
```

## Pre-PR Validation Policy

When work orders define exact unit, integration, and E2E commands and two
configured PR AI reviewers provide semantic review, make those commands the
default task-specific local pre-PR validation. The shared harness lint,
specification lint, diff checks, and targeted pre-commit hook required by
`validation.md` remain mandatory for skill and reference changes. Do not add
generic local simplify,
QA, code/security review, or broad verification passes. Run an extra local gate
only on explicit user request or to remediate a PR/CI finding.

## Placement Rules

- PR/CI/review-thread behavior belongs in `.agents/skills/pr-fixup/`.
- PR creation/body/push behavior belongs in `.agents/skills/pr/SKILL.md` or `.agents/skills/push/SKILL.md`.
- Full repo verification belongs in `.agents/skills/verify/SKILL.md`.
- TDD/test-level guidance belongs in `.agents/skills/tdd/SKILL.md`.
- E2E commands and flake triage belong in `.agents/skills/e2e/`.
- Runtime debugging belongs in `.agents/skills/debug/`.
- Backend/frontend conventions belong in the closest scoped `AGENTS.md`.
- Repeated fragile commands should become or update a `scripts/` helper, with syntax and mocked behavior checks.

## Deduplication Checklist

Before adding text:

1. `rg` for the key command, error string, or concept.
2. If the guidance already exists, strengthen the existing paragraph instead of adding a duplicate.
3. If two skills now cover the same workflow, route one to the other or delete the obsolete one.
4. Update references in router skills such as `using-agent-skills` when names change.

## Output Contract

Summarize the change as:

- Learning recorded: one sentence.
- Files changed: paths.
- Validation: commands run.
- Residual risk: anything not verified.
