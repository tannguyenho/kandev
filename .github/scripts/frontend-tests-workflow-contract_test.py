"""Contract tests for the frontend unit-test workflow's NODE_ENV guard.

React exports `act()` only from its development build, which it selects with
`process.env.NODE_ENV`. `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` pins that variable to
"test" so the development build always loads; without the pin, every
`render()` throws `TypeError: React.act is not a function` for anyone whose
shell inherits the runtime image's `NODE_ENV=production` (`Dockerfile`).

The pin cannot guard itself. The CI image sets no `NODE_ENV`, so Vitest's own
`process.env.NODE_ENV ??= "test"` already yields "test" there and the suite
passes whether or not the pin exists. `frontend-tests.yml` therefore exports
`NODE_ENV=production` on its test step on purpose, to reproduce the
environment that broke and make a deleted pin fail in CI.

These assertions exist because that export reads like a mistake: removing it
breaks nothing visibly, and CI silently stops guarding the fix.

        to name them in a hand-maintained `paths:` list so that a PR deleting
