# Kandev

Manage tasks. Orchestrate agents. Review changes. Ship value.

## Quick Start

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install kdlbs/kandev/kandev
kandev
```

### NPX (requires npm 7+)

```bash
npx kandev@latest
```

Either install path resolves a platform-matched runtime (Go backend, agentctl, and static Vite web assets), launches the backend, and opens your browser. Data (worktrees, SQLite DB) is stored in `~/.kandev` by default.

## Version and Updates

The package manager owns the runtime version. `kandev@X.Y.Z` ships with the matching runtime.

- **Update via Homebrew**: `brew upgrade kandev`
- **Update via npm/npx**: `npx kandev@latest` or `npm install -g kandev@latest`
- **Print CLI version**: `kandev --version`

## Run as a Service

Install kandev as a systemd (Linux) or launchd (macOS) service so it auto-starts and stays running across reboots:

```bash
kandev service install                   # user mode (laptop, single-user)
sudo kandev service install --system     # system mode (VPS, shared host)
```

See [docs/run-as-a-service.md](../../docs/run-as-a-service.md) for the full guide — user vs system mode comparison, update workflow, troubleshooting.
