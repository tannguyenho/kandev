 * Catalog keys for the office task status, task priority and project status

 *
 * Keys, not resolved labels: these are module-scope tables, so a `t()` here
 * would resolve once at import and freeze at the boot locale. Every consumer
 * resolves at render.
 *
 * The record keys are the wire `OfficeTaskStatus` / `OfficeTaskPriority` values
 * and are never translated — they are compared, persisted and sent to the
 * backend. Shared so the status icon, the board columns, the filter list and the
 * new-task chips cannot drift apart; each of them previously carried its own
 * copy of the same English labels.
 *
 * These are FALLBACKS. When `office.meta` is loaded, the workspace's own status
 * and priority labels win, and those are workspace data rather than copy.
