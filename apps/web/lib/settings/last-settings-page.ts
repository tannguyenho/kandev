 * `knownPaths` is the static settings route table (`SETTINGS_ROUTE_PATHS`), and
 * membership in it is the whole test. Restoring is a promise that the page will
 * still be there, and only a static first-party route can keep it:
 *
 * - **Unknown paths** (`/settings/does-not-exist`, a route dropped in an
 *   upgrade) would otherwise stick, because the settings shell renders — and so
 *   records — even when the route falls through to `SettingsRouteFallback`.
 * - **Record and slug routes** (`/settings/workspace/<id>/repositories`,
 *   `/settings/agents/<name>`, a plugin's `/settings/plugins/<slug>`) resolve
 *   against data that can disappear. Deciding whether one still resolves needs
 *   the workspace/agent/plugin list, and landing on a page for something that
 *   was deleted is worse than landing on the default.
 * - **`/settings` itself** is a route, so it needs excluding by hand: it is the
 *   route doing the restoring.
 *
 * Redirect stubs (`/settings/general/shell`, `/settings/system`, …) are
 * deliberately kept: they are static routes that replace the URL on mount, so
 * the next thing recorded is the page they land on.
