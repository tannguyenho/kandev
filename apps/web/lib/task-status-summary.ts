 * independent paths: `task.status_summary.updated` WS deltas, and whole-task
 * payloads from HTTP hydration (workflow snapshots, boot payload). Both write
 * the same cache, so ordering between them is not guaranteed — a snapshot
 * request issued before a delta can land after it. Every writer must therefore
 * compare revisions rather than assume it holds the latest reading.
 *
 * An absent `next` is never newer: HTTP payloads use `omitempty`, so a missing
 * summary means "not carried by this response", not "cleared".

 *
 * Taking the response unconditionally lets a slow response regress the cache to
 * an older revision. A settled task emits no further deltas, so that regression
 * is permanent until the next full hydrate — it surfaced as a task stuck behind
 * a "preparing" spinner in the sidebar after its turn had already finished.
 *
 * Equal revisions must still take the response, because not every field is
 * covered by the revision: `buildTaskDTOsWithSessionInfo` re-stamps
 * `queued_prompt_count` onto the loaded summary from a fresh queue read without
 * incrementing it (the initial-load backstop for queue mutations the projector
 * has not observed, e.g. after a restart). Preferring the cached copy at an
 * equal revision would pin a stale queued badge until the next projector event.
 * The revision-owned fields are identical at equal revisions, so taking the
 * response cannot reintroduce the staleness above.
