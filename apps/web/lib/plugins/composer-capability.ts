/**
 * Builds the `PluginComposerCapability` a mounted composer hands to its
 * plugin action slot.
 *
 * The returned object is stable across ordinary re-renders. That is the whole
 * point: a plugin action is inherently asynchronous (record, upload,
 * transcribe, then insert and maybe submit), so it holds the capability across
 * many host re-renders. Rebuilding it whenever `disabled`, `submittable` or the
 * native submit callback changed would revoke the object the plugin is still
 * holding and turn a completed transcription into `unavailable`.
 *
 * Liveness comes from the operations ref instead: each render republishes the
 * current closures, so `submit()` revalidates the native gate at call time
 * rather than against a snapshot taken when the plugin first got the object.
 * The ref is published in a layout effect so a handler running after paint
 * cannot read the previous render's gate.
 *
 * `identity` is what stops that stability from becoming a leak. A composer is
 * not remounted when the user switches task or session — task chat's container
 * is keyed only by its clarification key — so without it, a handle captured
 * while recording on one session would happily insert into the next one, which
 * the composer contract forbids. Pass whatever distinguishes one mounted
 * composer from another (surface, task, session); changing it revokes the old
 * handle and issues a new one, while ordinary disabled/submittable re-renders
 * leave it alone.
