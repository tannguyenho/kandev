 * every way the theme can flip — the settings picker, a live preview hover,

 * "system" — without the plugin host having to subscribe to React context it

 * unrelated churn — expensive for the canvas repaints this exists to drive.
 *
 * Never throws. These listeners are third-party plugin callbacks and this is
 * a cross-plugin fan-out, so one throwing listener must not starve the ones
 * after it — the same isolation `dispatchToPluginWsHandlers` and
 * `PluginErrorBoundary` already give every other plugin extension point.
 * Without it the damage outlives the throw: `lastTheme` has already advanced,
