/**
 * Locates the Slack-style unread ("New") divider boundary: the key of the

 *
 * Finds the item containing lastReadMessageId, then returns the key of the
 * next item that carries a real message. When lastReadMessageId falls inside
 * a turn_group (several messages bundled into one visual group), the whole
 * group counts as read and the divider lands after it — a group is never
 * split into read/unread halves.
 *
 * When lastReadMessageId isn't found among the currently loaded items, the
 * loaded window is treated as entirely unread — the divider goes before its
 * first real message — rather than suppressed. The common cause is an older
 * cursor pointing past the currently paginated window (the loaded messages
 * are the transcript's tail; older history hasn't been fetched yet), which
 * means everything visible really is unread. Returns null only when there is
 * no cursor at all (a brand-new session has nothing to mark "New" against),
 * or the cursor already points at the newest loaded message.
 *
 * The returned key mirrors message-list-shared.tsx's getItemKey format
 * (bare message id, or the item's own id for non-message items) — duplicated
 * inline rather than imported to avoid a circular import, since that module
 * imports RenderItem from hooks/use-processed-messages.ts. Keep the two in
 * sync.

 * the raw list's tail can be a message findUnreadDividerItemId will never
 * find among items — which it then (correctly, per its own contract) treats
