 * probes: Jira, Linear and Azure DevOps each run a fetch plus a 90s
 * `setInterval` per mounted consumer
 * (`hooks/domains/integrations/use-integration-availability.ts`). Use
 * `useStaticDestinations` for ungated sections so a nav surface doesn't add
 * background polling just to render a static link.
 *
 * Not memoized: the availability map is rebuilt each render, so a `useMemo` here
 * would never hit. Consumers map the result straight into JSX.

 *
 * Identical to `useAppDestinations` minus the availability subscription, so
 * these surfaces cost no background requests. `core-destinations.test.ts` enforces
 * the invariant that makes this safe: nothing outside `GATED_SECTIONS` declares
 * `requires`, and every palette entry is either ungated or opted out.
 *
 * Only the palette may omit `section` (first overload). Omitting it resolves
 * every section, gated ones included, against an empty availability map — which
 * is correct only because the palette's single gated entry opts out via
 * `palette.ignoreRequires`. On any other surface that would silently drop every
 * unconfigured integration, so the section is required there.
