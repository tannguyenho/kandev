/**
 * The sleep ratchet driven end to end against real git topologies.
 *
 * The rule has its own RuleTester suite and the diff parser has its own; those
 * prove the parts. This proves they are *connected* — that a sleep on a new line
 * actually reaches an exit code, and that a sleep on an untouched line actually
 * does not. A gate whose matcher is perfect but whose wiring is broken reports a
 * clean tree forever, which is the one failure mode nobody goes looking for.
 *
 * Every scenario is a real repository with the real `apps/web/e2e/…` layout and
 * the real eslint config, so nothing here can pass by mocking the thing under
 * test.
