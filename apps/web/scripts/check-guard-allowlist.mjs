/**
 * The i18n guard allowlist may only grow.
 *
 * `i18nGuardFiles` in eslint.i18n.options.mjs is what makes migrated code stay
 * migrated: once a path is listed, `i18next/no-literal-string` is an error there
 * forever. That protection has one obvious failure mode — someone hits the error,
 * deletes the entry, and the build goes green with the migration silently undone.
 * docs/i18n.md says never to do that; this makes it mechanical.
 *
 * Removing an entry is legitimate exactly once: when a file is deleted or renamed.
 * Both are detectable, so the check only complains when the path still exists.
 *
 * The list also has to stay honest about what it claims, so a second check
 * rejects a path listed twice. A duplicate costs nothing at runtime, so before
 * this check existed it slipped through every gate the repo had while quietly
 * presenting an earlier migration's work as the current PR's.
 *
 * A third check rejects an entry that matches no file. Both of the above compare
 * two STATES of the array and so cannot see an entry that was dead the day it
 * was written — which is what a dynamic route produces, since `[id]` is a glob
 * character class. That entry guards nothing while every check reports green.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-guard-allowlist.mjs [--base <ref-or-sha>]
