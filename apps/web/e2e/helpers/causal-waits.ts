/**
 * Causal waits — wait for the backend event that *causes* a UI change instead
 * of polling the UI for its shadow.
 *
 * The suite's dominant flake shape is a test that asserts on a rendered
 * consequence with a hand-picked budget:
 *
 * ```ts
 * await expect(button).toBeEnabled({ timeout: 30_000 }); // why 30s? nobody knows
 * ```
 *
 * The element rendered fine; it just never left its pending state inside the
 * budget, because the backend round trip that would flip it was late. Raising
 * the number buys time, it does not remove the race: under CI load the next
 * budget expires too.
 *
 * The fix is to name the cause. A pending UI state in this app is waiting on
 * exactly one of three observable things, and each has a primitive here:
 *
 * | The UI is waiting on…             | Use                               |
 * | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
 * | an HTTP request/response          | {@link waitForHttp}               |
 * | a server-pushed WS notification   | {@link watchWs}`.waitForEvent`    |
 * | a WS request/response round trip  | {@link watchWs}`.waitForResponse` |
 *
 * A fourth case — "the backend has reached state X" — needs no primitive:
 * `expect.poll(() => apiClient.getX(id))` against `helpers/api-client.ts`
 * already reads the backend directly rather than through the DOM.
 *
 * Two things here are not causal waits and are named so they stay visible:
 * {@link dwell}, the only sanctioned wall-clock wait, and
 * {@link injectLatency}, for slowing a mocked response on purpose.
 *
 * ## The one rule: arm before you act
 *
 * Every wait here is *armed* before the action that triggers it and awaited
 * after, because a signal that has already gone past cannot be waited for:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const branchesLoaded = waitForHttp(page, "GET", /\/repositories\/[^/]+\/branches/);
 * await createRepositoryButton.click();
 * await branchesLoaded; // the cause has landed…
 * await expect(branchSelector).toBeEnabled(); // …so this needs no budget
 * ```
 *
 * The trailing UI assertion keeps its default timeout on purpose: once the
 * cause has landed, all that is left is a React render, and a render slower
 * than the default is a real bug worth failing on.
 */

 * so a missed signal fails with this module's message (which names the signal)

 * Wait on the wall clock, on purpose, with a category and a reason.

 * This is the **only** sanctioned way to sleep in a spec. Raw
 * `page.waitForTimeout()` and hand-rolled promise sleeps are not: they are
 * indistinguishable, at a glance and to a grep, from someone who could not
 * find the right event and reached for a number instead.
 *
 * ```ts
 * await dwell(page, 300, "negative-assertion", "asserting the tooltip never opens");
 * await dwell(page, 300, "library-timer", "Radix open delay publishes no event");
 * ```
 *
 * Backend fixtures, the API client's retry loops, docker probing and the office
 * routing helpers have no `Page` at all, so there is a page-less form under the
 * same name -- one greppable token either way:
 *
 * ```ts
 * await dwell(500, "poll-interval", "backend health poll; no page exists yet");
 * ```
 *
 * Pass the page whenever one is in scope: the wait then dies with the page
 * rather than hanging past it. The page-less form is a plain timer.
 *
 * ## Choosing the category
 *
 * Several can look applicable at once, so categorize by *what makes the delay
 * unavoidable*, first match wins:
 *
 * 1. Is the assertion that something **never** happens? → `negative-assertion`.
 *    You always know this from the test itself, and it outranks whatever timer
 *    happens to be nearby.
 * 2. Otherwise you are waiting out a timer. Can you **name** it? → the matching
 *    one of `product-timer`, `library-timer`, `clock-separation`,
 *    `poll-interval`, `browser-chrome`.
 * 3. Cannot name it? → `unverified`. Do not guess a plausible-looking timer;
 *    an honest debt marker is worth more than a confident wrong label.
 *
 * `unverified` is a debt marker to be driven down, not a resting place. It is
 * the one category that should trend toward zero.
 *
 * `reason` must say *why no event exists*, not what the code is doing. "Radix
 * opens after 300ms and publishes nothing" is a reason; "wait for the tooltip"
 * is not — that one is a {@link waitForHttp} or {@link watchWs} wait that has
 * not been found yet, and reaching for `dwell` to avoid looking is the misuse
 * this helper exists to make visible.
 *
 * Deliberately has no options and no defaults. All of its value is in the name
 * being greppable, and the category and reason being mandatory.
