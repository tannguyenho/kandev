# Canvas manifest

Publish one `manifest.yaml` file at the root of the source directory returned
by `create_canvas_kandev`. Canvas packages use the current Kandev plugin
manifest schema, with `api_version: 2`. A static canvas package has no
`base_url` or managed backend endpoints.

This is a complete minimal example. The example uses a nested entry to show
that files next to the entry document can use normal relative URLs.

```yaml
id: example-canvas
api_version: 2
version: 1.0.0
display_name: Example canvas
description: A small task canvas.
author: Canvas author
min_kandev_version: "0.94.0"
ui:
  web_apps:
    - key: main
      title: Example canvas
      entry: ui/index.html
      placements:
        - task-canvas
        - workspace-canvas
      network_origins:
        - https://api.example.com
capabilities:
  api_read:
    - tasks
    - workflows
  api_write:
    - tasks
    - messages
  events:
    - task.updated
  state: true

distribution:
  schema_version: 1
  kind: canvas
  license: MIT
  source_mode: static
```

The host parses YAML and calls the same manifest validator used for plugin
registration. Required identity fields are `id`, `api_version`, `version`,
`display_name`, `description`, and `author`. `api_version` must be `1` or `2`;
new canvases must use `2`.

`ui.web_apps` contains one or more applications. Each application requires a
lowercase `key`, a `title`, a clean package-relative `entry`, and at least one
placement. A placement is `task-canvas` or `workspace-canvas`. The package may
contain `ui/index.html`, `ui/app.js`, and `ui/app.css`; references such as
`./app.js` resolve beside `ui/index.html`. Do not use absolute paths, `..`,
symlinks, or a path below `_kandev`.

`network_origins` contains exact HTTPS origins only. Do not add a path,
wildcard, credentials, query, or fragment. A new owner-created task canvas can
receive its declared exact origins in its first release through the initial
permission policy. Imported packages and later permission increases need an
approved grant before the release can run. Network requests go directly from
the sandboxed browser to the approved origin. If a release, grant, archive, or
canvas authority changes, the host immediately tears down the old iframe, so
the old direct requests cannot continue under the old binding.

Capabilities are declarations, not grants. Use `api_read` for `tasks` and
`workflows`, `api_write` for `tasks` and `messages`, `events` for event
subscriptions, and `state: true` for instance state. The owner-authorized
first release can receive only these supported task-scoped grants. The
operator reviews a later permission increase, an imported package, or a
workspace promotion. Request only the capabilities used by the application.

The package must include the declared entry document and every local asset it
references. Bundle executable dependencies. A build tool, package manager, or
network build step is not available when the canvas runs.

The host injects a reserved startup bootstrap into the entry document before
authored scripts. It checks document startup and relative context access. Keep
the entry valid HTML so the host can insert the bootstrap without changing the
stored package. The host waits up to 15 seconds for the startup acknowledgement
and exposes retry controls outside the frame when startup fails.

## Portable distribution

Use the `distribution` block when the canvas is intended for bundle, source, or
registry sharing. `kind` must be `canvas`, `schema_version` must be `1`, and
`source_mode` must be `static` or `project`. Include a non-empty license value
and a compatible `min_kandev_version` in the manifest.

The package must include `README.md` and generated `checksums.txt`. A project
source mode package retains the editable project in
`distribution/source/manifest.yaml` and `distribution/source/README.md`.
Static source mode does not include that subtree. Keep source files bounded and
free of secrets. The host rejects native plugin contributions, backend
executables, unsafe paths, and unsupported files in a portable canvas.

Registry screenshots are not package inputs. Add ordered preview objects to the
registry entry later. The first preview is the cover, canvas entries require
one to eight previews, and plugin entries may omit previews.
