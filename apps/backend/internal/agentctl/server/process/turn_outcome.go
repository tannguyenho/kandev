// (permission request/cancelled, MCP attachment, context window, session
// models, ...) is filtered out here rather than at each producer, since
// EventTypeComplete/EventTypeError is emitted from several independent
// places (this manager's own agent-ERROR and process-exit-error sends, and
// the ACP adapter's session/prompt completion and protocol-error paths) that
// all converge on updatesCh regardless of origin -- this is the single
// filter for all of them, called from every point an event is actually
// delivered onto updatesCh (forwardUpdates, sendUpdateBlocking).
//
// event is a pointer so the assigned turn identifier can be stamped onto
// ControlTurnID before the caller sends this same value onward -- callers
// must call this before the channel send, not after, or the stamp never
// reaches the delivered copy. AC-EXECUTORS-SURVIVAL-004.4 requires that
// identifier to travel on both the retained-read observation (returned via
// TurnOutcome.TurnID) and the live-delivered observation (this stamp); the
// retained copy stored by Retain is deliberately the pre-stamp value, since
// TurnOutcome.TurnID already carries the identifier for that side.
