// MonitorPayload is adapter-attested Monitor identity: proof that the ACP adapter

// sibling of GenericPayload rather than as a key inside GenericPayload.Output.
//
// The distinction is the whole point. `Generic.Output` is assigned the agent's
// raw tool result verbatim (NormalizeToolResult), so any structure *inside* it is
// agent-shaped data — an unrelated tool whose result happened to serialize a
// monitor-looking map would be indistinguishable from a real Monitor, no matter
// how many fields the classifier demanded. This slot, by contrast, is only ever
// written by the adapter's Monitor recognizer (via SetMonitorIdentity), which
// gates on ACP `_meta.claudeCode.toolName` — metadata the claude-agent-acp
// wrapper sets, which model tool output cannot reach. Nothing in the normalize
// path ever copies agent data here, so a payload carrying it provably came off
// the Monitor path.
//
// It survives the agentctl→orchestrator boundary as its own `monitor` key on the
// serialized payload, so the classifier on the far side reads the same attestation.

// kind (see acp/monitor.go). A Monitor is long-running background work the
// foreground turn is not actively generating against, so an active one is treated
// like any other spawned background task by the busy signal (ADR-0049).
//
// It classifies on the adapter's attestation (MonitorPayload), never on the shape
// of Generic.Output — that field is the agent's own raw tool result and so can
// neither prove nor disprove provenance. This is what keeps the ADR-0049 contract
// honest: an agent we don't recognize cannot relax its own busy gate by emitting a
// monitor-shaped tool result, and keeps the historical reject-while-RUNNING
// behavior. (The payload's `Name` is likewise unusable as a discriminator: it
// carries the ACP tool kind, which is "other" for Monitor, not "Monitor".)
