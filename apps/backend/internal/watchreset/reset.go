// Package watchreset orchestrates "reset" for integration watches
// (GitHub issue / GitHub review / Jira / Linear / Sentry). A reset is a
// destructive operation that:
//
//  1. Deletes every Kandev task previously created by the watch (cascade,
//     including archived tasks — "wipe the slate").
//  2. Wipes the per-watch dedup rows so the next poll re-considers every
//     currently-matching external item.
//  3. Clears the watch's last_polled_at so it polls immediately.
//
// Each integration implements the small Resetter interface against its own
// store, and calls Run with a *task.HandoffService for the cascade delete.

// the only fatal error is the dedup/clear step itself.

// Once started, the reset runs to completion even if the caller's context
// is cancelled (e.g. the HTTP client disconnects mid-reset). A half-applied

// safely. The cancel signal is preserved for deadlines that arrive
// before Run is invoked, but not for ones that fire after.
