// variants) when admitOrDeferSeam1 refuses admission: a ceiling_deferred
// record has already been written from the caller's own launch parameters,
// so this launch will be replayed automatically once capacity frees up
// rather than failing outright. A caller that only distinguishes "session
// created" (non-nil execution) from "hard failure" (non-nil error) has no
// way to notice this without checking for this sentinel — the nil execution
// looks the same as it would for an ordinary success it forgot to populate.
// Callers that only care whether the caller-visible request itself is
// blocked (GitHub/automation/watcher auto-start, which hold a one-shot
// claim that a real failure must restore) should treat this sentinel the
// same as a successful dispatch, since the sweep owns retrying it; callers
// that record launch bookkeeping (Office scheduler launch counters, health,
// persisted session id) must treat it as "not launched yet" instead of a
// success.
