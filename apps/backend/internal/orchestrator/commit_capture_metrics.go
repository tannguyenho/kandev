// expvar maps published at package init under /debug/vars (dev profile, see
// apps/backend/AGENTS.md Observability), mirroring the office scheduler's
// routing_* counters (internal/office/scheduler/metrics_vars.go). Each
// observed commit increments "observed" plus exactly one of
// inserted/duplicate/failed, broken down by which write path saw it -
// commitCaptureTriggerLive (handleGitCommitCreated), ...Sweep (the
// agent-completed reconcile pass), or ...Archive (archive capture,
// unchanged as the final reconciliation pass). A trigger that stops
// incrementing while the others keep moving is the writer-health signal:
// one path silently stopped without the whole feature going dark.

	// per-repo failure inside a multi-repo response's PerRepoErrors - broken
	// down by trigger. These happen before any commit is even observed, so
	// they are accounted separately from commitCaptureFailed (a known
	// commit's DB-write failure, paired with commitCaptureObserved via the
	// observed = inserted + duplicate + failed identity); folding fetch
	// failures into that counter would break the identity.
