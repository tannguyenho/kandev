// OrderedIDConcat returns the SQL fragment for a scalar subquery that
// comma-joins the `id` column of `SELECT id FROM tasks WHERE <where>`, in
// ascending id order. The two dialects place the ordering differently:
// SQLite's GROUP_CONCAT has no ORDER BY of its own, so ordering comes from
// an ORDER BY inside the subquery; PostgreSQL's string_agg takes an ORDER BY
// inside the aggregate call itself. Writing one and assuming the other
// matches is how the two dialects silently diverge on row order — see
// docs/specs/office/system-design/parent-wake-wave-identity.md, "Backstop
// admission".
//
// where is the WHERE clause body (no leading "WHERE", no trailing
// "ORDER BY") of the `tasks` subquery — the caller supplies the predicate,
// this helper only owns the aggregate/order-by placement split.
//
//	SQLite:   (SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(w.id, ',') FROM (SELECT id FROM tasks WHERE <where> ORDER BY id) w)
//	Postgres: (SELECT string_agg(w.id, ',' ORDER BY w.id) FROM (SELECT id FROM tasks WHERE <where>) w)
