// a stored policy (AC-OFFICE-BUDGET-002.5/.11/.14). All fields are detected
// in the same pass, never short-circuited at the first, so a policy
// violating more than one criterion can be named for all of them in a
// single activity entry (AC-OFFICE-BUDGET-002.13). Aliased from models so
// internal/office/service can read a PreLaunchPolicyResult's SkipIssues
// without importing this package.

// classifyStoredPolicy implements AC-OFFICE-BUDGET-002.5/.11/.14: a stored
// policy the build cannot evaluate as written — an unrecognized period,
// scope type, or action, a non-positive limit, or an agent/project scope
// with no scope_id — is skipped by the caller rather than evaluated as a
// lifetime window or as matching every run whose corresponding identifier
// is also empty. Unlike validateBudgetPolicyWrite (AC-002.6/.7, which only
// guards new writes), this covers every stored row regardless of how it
// got there — a row written before validation shipped, or by any path that
// bypasses the write API.
