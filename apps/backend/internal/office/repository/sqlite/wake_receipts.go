// directly against the last-delivered receipt — no hashing, SQLite has no
// built-in hash function — computed here, in SQL, so the sweep stays a
// single query per tick.

	// child that completed, was reopened, and completed again with the same
	// terminal state from one that was never touched — both produce the

// ListStuckParents finds parent tasks that look done from their children's
// perspective — not archived, not ephemeral, not already terminal, with at
// least one non-archived child, and with no non-archived child left in a
// non-terminal state — and that have not yet had a task_children_completed
// wake delivered for their current child set, by anyone.
//
// The p.archived_at/is_ephemeral/state filters run over every task row
// regardless of Office adoption; taskrepo.IsFromOfficePredicate narrows
// that down to parents this reconciler may actually act on. HasOfficeAdoption
// (the Tick-level gate in ParentWakeReconciler) only proves some workspace
// somewhere has adopted Office — it says nothing about this parent's own
// task or workspace, so without this predicate a Kanban-only parent in an
// unrelated workspace, or in the same workspace as an Office project it has
// no connection to, could still match every other filter and receive an
// unrequested autonomous run. ListUnstartedTasks
// (tasks.go, the sibling query this reconciler mirrors) applies the same
// predicate for the same reason.
//
// Archived children are deliberately excluded from both the "has a child"
// and "any non-terminal" checks below — this is a divergence from
// AreAllChildrenTerminal (blockers.go), which counts every child
// regardless of archived_at and so can be blocked forever by an archived
// child stuck mid-flight. Do not "fix" this back to match
// AreAllChildrenTerminal; the divergence is intentional so an archived
// child can never wedge the reconciler, and a parent whose only children
// are archived is never swept with a spurious empty child-set key.
//
// Every remaining filter runs in SQL, ahead of LIMIT, not in the caller
// afterward:
//   - the LEFT JOIN against parent_child_wake_receipts drops a candidate
//     whose stored receipt already matches its current child set and whose
//     delivery evidence still exists. A receipt created by the workflow
//     engine stores a child-set operation id. A legacy receipt stores a run
//     id, and any existing run is evidence that the wake entered the queue.
//     Terminal execution failures stay terminal under the Office runtime
//     contract; they require an explicit user retry and must not become a
//     cron retry loop. A missing referenced run remains eligible because a
//     cleanup or migration can remove the delivery evidence.
//   - a third OR arm, newest_child_updated_at != child_generation, re-admits
//     a candidate whose child_set_key still matches the receipt exactly. A
//     child that completes, is reopened, and completes again with the same
//     terminal state produces a byte-identical child_set_key (it encodes
//     "id:state" only), so the first two arms both stay false and the
//     re-completion would otherwise never be swept. The edge-triggered path
//     (cascadeChildrenCompleted) also cannot catch this: its idempotency key
//     hashes child ids only, so an identical child set collides with the
//     run it already persisted for the first completion. child_generation
//     is the newest_child_updated_at value recorded at delivery time, so
//     this is an equality check between two rendered-text values, not an
//     ordering comparison against delivered_at: tasks.updated_at is written
//     by more than one producer in more than one text format (see
//     recordReceipt), so ordering two differently-formatted strings is
//     unreliable in a way equality between two same-format strings is not.
//     Both newest_child_updated_at here and the comparison below against
//     runs.requested_at go through dialect.SecondPrecisionText rather than
//     comparing the raw TIMESTAMP columns as text: SQLite's CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
//     only ever writes whole-second text, but Postgres defaults to
//     microsecond precision, so an unnormalized comparison against
//     child_generation (a plain TEXT column) is a type mismatch on Postgres,
//     and reading the raw value into a Go string would carry driver-specific
//     formatting the two dialects don't agree on.
//   - the NOT EXISTS against runs drops a candidate with a queued or
//     claimed task_children_completed run (still in flight, regardless of
//     which child set it was requested for — wait for it to resolve rather
//     than race a duplicate) or a terminal one whose wake_wave_string
//     matches the parent's current wave string (parent-wake-wave-identity):
//     it already delivered this exact wave, including a failed or
//     cancelled one that must remain terminal under the Office runtime
//     contract and be unblocked only by an explicit retry or a real
//     wave-member change. A separate clause keeps a parent-scoped (not
//     per-row) compatibility path for pre-upgrade rows: only when the
//     parent has no task_children_completed run carrying a wave identity
//     at all (wake_wave_key is empty), in any status, does a terminal run
//     requested at or after newest_child_updated_at still block under the
//     original timestamp rule — this is R3-A's fix, replacing a plain "any
//     terminal run ever" check that let one finished run permanently
//     immunize a parent against every later child-set change. The
//     compatibility path is bounded and self-clearing: the first wave-keyed
//     run recorded for a parent retires it for that parent from then on.
//     queueChildrenCompletedRun and cascadeChildrenCompleted (the
//     edge-triggered delivery paths) never write a receipt, so the receipt
//     alone cannot tell a healthy edge-delivered wake from a lost one;
//     evidence of delivery has to come from runs itself.
//   - a second EXISTS, over the wave-member predicate (not archived, not
//     ephemeral, not automation-origin — the same predicate
//     ListWaveMembers applies), removes a parent with no possible wave from
//     candidacy: without it such a parent would be listed every tick,
//     found to have no wave, queue nothing, and be listed again. Additive
//     and narrowing only — it sits
//     beside the existing archived-only EXISTS, never replacing it.
//   - requiring a non-empty assignee_agent_profile_id drops a candidate
//     with no resolvable runner, and the INNER JOIN against agent_profiles
//     drops one whose runner is paused, stopped, pending approval, or
//     altogether missing (a dangling assignee_agent_profile_id with no
//     matching row) — R3-B's fix: a LEFT JOIN treated "no matching row" as
//     COALESCE'd-to-idle, which passed a dangling reference straight
//     through as a sticky, unresolvable, LIMIT-slot-consuming candidate.
//
// This is an invariant, not four independent filters: any predicate that
// can stay true for the same parent across consecutive ticks MUST be
// applied here, before LIMIT — never in Go after ListStuckParents returns.
// A parent with no runner, or a paused runner, does not resolve itself on
// its own; left as a Go-side rejection it would occupy a LIMIT slot on
// every tick forever, permanently starving any genuinely actionable
// candidate behind it. Go-side rejection is only admissible for a
// condition that can change between this SELECT and the write a moment
// later (guardAgentStatus in the caller is exactly that — a cheap,
// redundant closing of that race window, not the primary filter).
