// DispatchStepEntry never runs these: running them a second time would
// launch or prompt an agent twice (AC-OFFICE-STEP-ENTRY-001.3, .5). Reads
// the single ownership declaration (AC-OFFICE-STEP-ENTRY-DISPATCH-002.1)

// DispatchStepEntry executes the session-independent half of the step's
// declared on_enter sequence for one committed arrival at (workflowID,
// stepID). Callers are the registered step-transition ledger writers, once
// per committed row that names a destination step, synchronously after
// their own commit (AC-OFFICE-STEP-ENTRY-001.1, .8, .9).
//
// Unlike HandleTrigger, this requires no live session, uses a
// record-and-continue loop instead of aborting on the first failed action
// (AC-OFFICE-STEP-ENTRY-001.4, .6), and carries entryID — the ledger row's
// own identifier — rather than an operation id
// (AC-OFFICE-STEP-ENTRY-001.2, .7). It bypasses HandleTrigger's
// already-applied/mark-applied bookkeeping entirely: per design, there is no
// separate "this entry already ran" marker. Each dispatched action is
// individually idempotent against durable state keyed by entryID
// (AC-OFFICE-STEP-ENTRY-001.10) — see
// docs/specs/office/system-design/step-entry-sequence-execution.md
// ("Where 'this entry already ran' is recorded").
//
// markerEntryID is the workflow_step_entries row allocated for this arrival
// (0 when none was allocated). A marker-bearing action (clear_decisions,
// queue_run_for_each_participant — stepentry.MarkerBearing) is routed through
// markerExecutor when both it and markerEntryID are set, claiming its marker
// before executing so a redelivered arrival is a safe no-op
// (AC-OFFICE-STEP-ENTRY-DISPATCH-002.3/.4). Per AC-002.10, a marker-bearing
// action that fails or loses its claim abandons the remainder of this
// entry's sequence — later positions must not run against state an earlier,
// unfinished marker-bearing action never actually produced (e.g. the fan-out
// after a clear_decisions that never committed). Every other ledger-owned
// kind keeps the pre-convergence record-and-continue behaviour.
