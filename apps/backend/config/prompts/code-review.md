Please review the changed files in the current git worktree.

STEP 1: Determine what to review
- First, check if there are any uncommitted changes (dirty working directory)
- If there are uncommitted/staged changes: review those files
- If the working directory is clean: review ONLY the commits from this branch
  - Run: git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch' to find the default branch name
  - Set BASE_REF to origin/<default-branch> using the reported branch
  - Use: git log --oneline $(git merge-base "$BASE_REF" HEAD)..HEAD to list the branch commits
  - Use: git diff $(git merge-base "$BASE_REF" HEAD) to see the cumulative changes
  - Do NOT diff directly against BASE_REF or origin/main/master - that would include unrelated changes if the branch is outdated
- Read each changed file in full — understand surrounding code, not just the diff
- Navigate callers, interfaces, and tests to understand changes end-to-end
- Check git blame on modified sections to understand why code was written a certain way
- Only REPORT issues on code modified in this changeset, but USE the full codebase for context

If a code review skill is available (e.g. /code-review, /review), invoke it instead of using the fallback below.

STEP 2: Review the changes across these layers (skip layers that don't apply):

ARCHITECTURAL FIT (highest priority):

- Changes belong in the correct layer/module and follow the dependency direction used by the codebase
- Business/domain logic is not placed in controllers, transport handlers, repositories, data sources, or infrastructure code
- Controllers handle protocol concerns, use cases orchestrate workflows, repositories define persistence needs, and data sources handle external systems
- Domain/application code does not depend on frameworks, transport models, database models, or vendor-specific types
- Changes do not bypass existing boundaries, duplicate responsibilities, or introduce unnecessary coupling between modules or domains
- New interfaces and abstractions have clear ownership and represent a meaningful boundary, rather than wrapping a single implementation
- Compare with neighbouring features and established patterns, but flag deviations only when they create a real architectural or maintainability problem
- Treat fundamental architectural misplacement or broken dependency direction as a blocker

DATA & STATE MODELLING:

- Domain entities, value objects, DTOs, persistence models, and external API models remain separate where their responsibilities differ
- State transitions and invariants are explicit and cannot create invalid or partially updated state
- There is a single clear source of truth; state or business rules are not duplicated across layers
- Nullability, optional fields, defaults, and invalid combinations are modelled deliberately
- Persistence schemas or transport types are not leaking implementation details into domain/application contracts
- Concurrency, retries, partial failures, and duplicate requests cannot corrupt state or apply transitions more than once
- Backward compatibility, migrations, and mixed-version behaviour are considered when contracts or persisted data change

SECURITY (blockers if found):

- No secrets, tokens, or credentials in code
- Input validation at system boundaries (user input, API handlers, external data)
- No SQL injection, XSS, command injection, or path traversal
- Auth and authorization checks on new endpoints
- No insecure crypto (MD5/SHA1 for passwords, weak random)

LOGIC & CORRECTNESS:
- Edge cases handled (empty input, nil/null, zero, max values)
- Error paths covered and not silently swallowed
- Race conditions or concurrency issues (unprotected shared state, missing synchronization, goroutine leaks)
- Broken invariants — state that can become invalid

PERFORMANCE:
- No N+1 queries (loop with individual DB calls)
- No memory leaks (unclosed connections, streams, listeners)
- Algorithm complexity appropriate for data scale (O(n^2) where O(n) is possible)
- Unnecessary allocations in loops, regex compilation in hot paths, unbounded resource growth
- Prefer structured concurrency (errgroup, conc) over raw primitives

CODE QUALITY:
- No dead code, unused imports, or commented-out code
- Check for orphaned code: if the change refactored or removed callers, grep for functions/types/exports that lost their last consumer
- No speculative code (unused flags, one-off abstractions with single call site)
- No duplicated logic — extract shared helpers or constants
- Deep nesting (>3 levels) — use early returns

AI SLOP DETECTION:
- Comments that restate code or narrate obvious steps
- Unnecessary try/catch that swallow errors or return silent defaults
- as any / as unknown casts to dodge type errors instead of fixing types
- Redundant validation where inputs are already parsed/typed
- Defensive checks abnormal for the area — compare with surrounding code patterns

STEP 3: Output your findings.

Every finding needs: file:line, what's wrong, why it matters, and how to fix it.
Only report findings you're >=80% confident about.

Use these sections (omit empty ones):

## BLOCKER
Must fix before merge — security holes, data loss risk, broken logic, crashes.

- file:line - Description. Why it matters. How to fix.

## SUGGESTION
Recommended but doesn't block — performance, architecture, missing tests.

- file:line - Description. Why it matters. How to fix.

End with a verdict: Ready to merge / Ready with suggestions / Blocked — fix blockers first

NOT A FINDING (skip these):
- Issues on lines or files the change didn't modify — even if they are real bugs
- Pre-existing code patterns that this change didn't introduce
- Things linters, typecheckers, or CI catch (imports, types, formatting)
- Intentional functionality changes directly related to the task
- Issues explicitly suppressed in code (lint-ignore, nolint comments)
- Pedantic nitpicks a senior engineer wouldn't flag
- General "add more tests" without specifying what logic is untested
