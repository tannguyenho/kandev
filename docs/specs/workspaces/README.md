# Workspace system

## Purpose

The workspace system owns workspace lifecycle, repositories, worktrees,
branches, branch policies, workspace secrets, and workspace-scoped execution context.

## Ownership

This system owns workspace creation and deletion, repository attachment,
repository sets, local repositories, branch templates, secrets, and workspace
Git state.

Workspace context identity, cached collection isolation, and navigation recovery
after failed reads also belong here.

## Exclusions

- Task-owned worktree lifetime belongs to the [task system](../tasks/README.md).
- Provider credentials belong to the [integration system](../integrations/README.md).
- Workspace settings presentation belongs to the [UI system](../ui/README.md).

## Migration record

Migration remains in progress while legacy source detail is extracted from the
canonical requirement and system-design documents. Use the catalog command to
find current sources.

## Related systems

- [Tasks](../tasks/README.md): consumes workspace repositories and worktrees.
- [Integrations](../integrations/README.md): supplies remote repository identity.
- [Platform](../platform/README.md): owns shared read capacity and persistence health.
