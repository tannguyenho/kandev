# Step-entry number requirements

The one capability this system ships: a server-computed step-entry number
substituted into workflow prompt templates, so the agent never counts its own
prose. System-wide terminology, non-functional constraints and exclusions are
in [../README.md](../README.md).

## Why

A board workflow keeps three things in the task plan as prose that have typed
homes: the review round count, the findings ledger, and the verdicts. This system
addresses the first of the three; the findings ledger is named in README Out of
scope 7 and the verdicts are untouched.

The round cap is enforced today by instructing the agent to count plan lines
beginning with `## SPEC REVIEW VERDICT:` — a string that appears in no Go, TS or
Markdown file here. The agent counts its own prose. Measured against the live
database (2026-09-01) that count is already wrong: task `e6177a00` carries **12
verdict headings** against **5 real transitions into its Spec Review step**, so a
5-round cap would have fired more than twice too early, and three further tasks
carry 6 to 8 headings against **zero** ledger rows. This is therefore a
**correctness fix, not a token optimisation** — expect no measurable token change
from it.


## Requirements

### REQ-TWS-001: Server-computed step-entry number in workflow prompt templates

Workflow prompt templates can request the number of the current step entry, and
the server substitutes it. The agent never counts.

- **AC-TWS-001.1:** When a workflow prompt template contains the token
  `{step_entry_number}`, the built prompt shall contain the decimal entry number
  in its place, with no braces.
- **AC-TWS-001.2:** The entry number shall be **1-based and inclusive of the
  current entry**: the first time a task is at a step the value is `1`, and on the
  fifth entry it is `5`. A prompt reading "this is entry N" is correct as written.
- **AC-TWS-001.3:** The entry number shall be derived from
  `COUNT(*) FROM task_step_transitions WHERE task_id = ? AND to_workflow_step_id = ?`
  for the task and the step the prompt is being built for.
- **AC-TWS-001.4:** When the recorded entry count is `0`, the substituted value
  shall be `1`. A task whose prompt is being built is at that step, so it has
  entered at least once; `0` would be false and would render "entry 0".
- **AC-TWS-001.5:** Substitution shall apply at both production call sites — the
  step prompt and the workflow-level prompt — so a template works wherever it is
  authored.
- **AC-TWS-001.6:** When the template does not contain `{step_entry_number}`, no
  count query shall be issued. Prompt building happens on every step entry and every
  session launch, so a template that does not ask must not pay (NFR-1).
- **AC-TWS-001.7:** The substituted value shall be rendered in base 10 with no
  thousands separator, no sign, and no leading zeros: `1`, `5`, `12`.
- **AC-TWS-001.8:** When the task identifier or the step identifier is empty, no
  count query shall be issued and the substituted value shall be `1`. The ledger
  normalises `""` to `NULL`, so the query could only return `0`, which AC-TWS-001.4
  already floors at `1`.
- **AC-TWS-001.9:** `{task_id}` and `{step_entry_number}` may both appear in one
  template and shall not interact. Neither substituted value can contain a brace
  token, so the order in which the two are applied is not observable.
- **AC-TWS-001.10:** Substitution shall replace **every** occurrence of the exact
  literal `{step_entry_number}`, matching `{task_id}`'s existing multi-occurrence
  behaviour. No other form is recognised, so `{{step_entry_number}}` renders as
  `{5}` on entry 5 — the inner literal matches, the outer braces remain. Accepted
  rather than special-cased: the token is new, no template uses it, and a doubled
  form has no second meaning to assign. `{{task_prompt}}` is unaffected, containing
  no such literal (AC-TWS-002.5).

### REQ-TWS-002: The entry number degrades visibly, never silently

Every failure mode leaves evidence rather than a plausible wrong number, because
a fabricated value silently disables a cap. AC-TWS-002.1 to AC-TWS-002.5 are
observable at runtime. **AC-TWS-002.6 alone is verifiable by inspection** — it
constrains a doc comment rather than behaviour — and Verification case 16 records
that, so its absence from a runtime assertion is a stated carve-out, not a gap.

- **AC-TWS-002.1:** When the count query returns an error, the token
  `{step_entry_number}` shall be left in the prompt **verbatim**, and the failure
  shall be logged at warn level with the task and step identifiers. An
  un-substituted token is visible to a reader; an invented number is not.
- **AC-TWS-002.2:** A count query failure shall not fail prompt building. The
  rest of the prompt shall be built and delivered unchanged.
- **AC-TWS-002.3:** Tokens other than `{task_id}` and `{step_entry_number}` shall
  pass through byte-for-byte unchanged, so an un-migrated prompt degrades visibly
  rather than rendering an empty cap.

- **AC-TWS-002.4:** `{task_id}` substitution shall be byte-for-byte identical to
  its behaviour before this change, including when the template contains several
  occurrences and when it contains none.
- **AC-TWS-002.5:** `{{task_prompt}}` shall survive interpolation byte-for-byte.
  It is consumed by `buildWorkflowPromptWithContext` **after** interpolation, so
  damaging it silently discards the task's base prompt.
- **AC-TWS-002.6:** The entry number shall be documented — in the doc comment of
  the function that computes it — as a **lower bound**: entries before the ledger's
  first row (2026-08-16) are not recorded and cannot be counted. Under-counting
  makes a cap fire late; over-counting makes it fire early, which is the failure
  this card exists to remove.


## Verification

One line per case; the cited AC is authoritative for the expected value.


1. N recorded entries **including the current one** → `{step_entry_number}` is N.
   "Recorded" means rows already committed to the ledger when the count is read,
   which per AC-TWS-005.2 always includes the current entry's own row. A fixture
   holding N-1 earlier entries plus the current one therefore expects N, never N+1;
   stating it as "N prior entries" would invert the boundary this card exists to fix
   (001.2, .3).
2. Zero ledger rows → `1`, not `0`, no error (001.4).
3. A count-query error leaves the token literal, logs at warn, and still returns the
   rest of the prompt (002.1, .2).
4. `{unknown_token}` survives unchanged (002.3).
5. `{task_id}` byte-for-byte unchanged — the three existing `sysprompt_test.go`
   cases pass untouched (002.4).
6. `{{task_prompt}}` survives and is still detected by
   `buildWorkflowPromptWithContext`, base prompt substituted (002.5).
7. A template without the token issues no query — asserted against a counting fake,
   not inferred (001.6).
8. A second build for the same entry returns the same number (005.1).
9. Both call sites substitute (001.5).
10. Empty task or step identifier → `1`, no query (001.8).
11. A template with both tokens substitutes both (001.9).
12. Every occurrence in one template is substituted (001.10).
13. `{{step_entry_number}}` renders as `{5}` on entry 5, asserted so a change cannot
    make it silently different (001.10).
14. A leave-and-return yields the next number, not the previous (005.1).
15. Both templates carrying the token in one build issue one query each and the
    build completes — the bound NFR-1 states (001.5, .6, 005.2).
16. The doc comment on the function that computes the count states the value is a
    **lower bound**. Checked by reading that comment, not by a runtime assertion:
    the ledger's first row (2026-08-16) is a fact about this database's history
    that no fixture reproduces, so there is nothing to assert against. This case
    exists so the requirement is discharged explicitly rather than by silence
    (002.6).
