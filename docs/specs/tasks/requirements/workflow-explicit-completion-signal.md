# Explicit Workflow-Step Completion Signal Requirements

## Overview

This document is the migrated task-system source for the capability. The source detail below remains authoritative while the system is migrated into separate requirement and design records.

## Requirements

### REQ-TASKS-WORKFLOW-EXPLICIT-COMPLETION-SIGNAL-001: Explicit Workflow-Step Completion Signal

**Intent:** Preserve the observable task or workflow behavior recorded by the legacy specification.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-TASKS-WORKFLOW-EXPLICIT-COMPLETION-SIGNAL-001.1:** When a consumer uses this capability, the system shall provide the observable behavior and exclusions documented below.

### REQ-TASKS-WORKFLOW-EXPLICIT-COMPLETION-SIGNAL-002: Signal-Gated Manual Move Visibility

**Intent:** Keep the normal workflow recovery action available when an explicit
completion signal, rather than a bare turn end, controls automatic advancement.

**User story:** As a user reviewing an idle signal-gated task, I want the
composer to offer the configured next workflow step, so that I can move the task
when the agent did not emit its completion signal.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-TASKS-WORKFLOW-EXPLICIT-COMPLETION-SIGNAL-002.1:** When an idle task's
  current step declares an `on_turn_complete` `move_to_next` action and
  `auto_advance_requires_signal=true`, task composer surfaces that normally
  provide the adjacent-next-step action shall show the configured next step.
  This does not extend to `move_to_previous` or `move_to_step`, because the
  existing composer action submits the adjacent next step and cannot represent
  either configured destination safely.
- **AC-TASKS-WORKFLOW-EXPLICIT-COMPLETION-SIGNAL-002.2:** When a step declares
  the same `on_turn_complete` `move_to_next` action without requiring a
  completion signal, task composer surfaces shall continue to suppress the
  redundant next-step action.
- **AC-TASKS-WORKFLOW-EXPLICIT-COMPLETION-SIGNAL-002.3:** While the task's agent
  is busy, task composer surfaces shall hide the next-step action and shall
  evaluate its visibility again when the agent becomes idle.
- **AC-TASKS-WORKFLOW-EXPLICIT-COMPLETION-SIGNAL-002.4:** The signal-gated
  setting shall produce the same next-step visibility after initial hydration,
  workflow snapshot refresh, and live workflow-step updates.
- **AC-TASKS-WORKFLOW-EXPLICIT-COMPLETION-SIGNAL-002.5:** While the current
  session has a pending durable clarification, task composer surfaces shall
  hide the next-step action even when the session is waiting for input. After
  the clarification barrier clears, the surfaces shall reevaluate visibility
  and show the action when the signal-gated idle conditions are satisfied.

## Migrated source detail

## Why

Signal-gated Kanban and Office workflows need a reliable distinction between an agent ending a turn and an agent completing the current workflow step. If the completion tool disappears from an agent client's deferred catalog during an MCP reconnect, finished work remains stuck even though Kandev still expects an explicit signal.

## What

- `step_complete_kandev` is a task-session capability. It is registered in `ModeTask` and `ModeOffice`, and is never registered or advertised in `ModeConfig` or `ModeExternal`.
- Task-mode and Office-mode registration is stable for the lifetime of the MCP server. A workflow step's `auto_advance_requires_signal` setting controls prompt instructions and transition behavior, not whether the tool exists in either tool list.
- When the current step requires an explicit signal, the first-turn context tells the agent to call `step_complete_kandev` as its last action after satisfying every requirement. Ungated Office steps keep the tool available but do not receive this imperative instruction.
- The canonical MCP protocol name is `step_complete_kandev`. Clients may expose a runtime-qualified alias such as `mcp__kandev__step_complete_kandev`; Kandev instructions distinguish the canonical name from client-specific qualification instead of claiming that one display form is universal.
- `step_complete_kandev` carries no vendor-specific eager-load metadata. Agents use their normal MCP catalog or tool-search mechanism to discover it in Kanban task mode.
- Creating or loading an ACP session supplies the local Kandev MCP server. After a transient MCP reconnect, the client can list and call `step_complete_kandev` again without a user message or process restart.
- Kandev does not pin the Claude ACP bridge version as part of this feature. Bridge selection retains the existing unversioned package behavior; diagnostics continue to report the version returned during ACP initialization.
- Existing idempotency, clarification barriers, and re-open semantics remain unchanged. ADR 0015's planned manual "Mark complete & advance" fallback is not currently implemented and is outside this reliability fix.
- The ordinary adjacent-next-step action remains available after an idle turn
  on a signal-gated step whose `on_turn_complete` action is `move_to_next`. It
  uses the existing manual task-move path and does not create a
  `manual_fallback` completion signal. Signal-gated `move_to_previous` and
  `move_to_step` actions remain outside this visibility exception because the
  existing composer action always submits the adjacent next step.
- Explicit user-cancel completion is owned by the [Cancelled Turn Completion](workflow-cancelled-turn-completion.md) spec. When a step opts into that policy, the user's cancel action is a human completion decision and may run `on_turn_complete` without an agent-emitted signal; internal cancellation paths remain non-completing.

## API Surface

### MCP tool

`ModeTask` exposes:

```json
{
  "name": "step_complete_kandev",
  "arguments": {
    "summary": "string",
    "handoff": "string?",
    "blockers": "string?"
  }
}
```

The tool uses the standard MCP definition without `anthropic/alwaysLoad`. Client-side deferred discovery does not change handler authorization, persistence, idempotency, or workflow transition semantics.

### Mode boundary

| MCP mode | `step_complete_kandev` |
|---|---|
| `ModeTask` | Registered |
| `ModeOffice` | Registered |
| `ModeConfig` | Not registered or advertised |
| `ModeExternal` | Not registered or advertised |

## Failure Modes

- If the Kandev MCP transport is temporarily disconnected, the client reports the transport failure and retries its normal connection path. It must not convert the failure into a permanent "tool does not exist" conclusion while the server is reconnecting.
- If a connected client defers the tool from its active context, the agent uses that client's normal tool-search mechanism to resolve the canonical `step_complete_kandev` name.
- If reconnect does not recover, the task stays on the current step. The user can retry the agent or move the task through the normal workflow UI; Kandev never auto-advances from a bare halt on a signal-gated step.
- If an Office step requires a signal, a failure to load or call the tool keeps the task on the current step. The user can retry the agent or move the task through the normal workflow UI.

## Persistence Guarantees

The pending completion signal continues to use `TaskSession.Metadata` as specified by ADR 0015. Tool catalog state is not persisted; it is reconstructed from the session's MCP mode on new session, load, and reconnect. ACP bridge package resolution remains external to session data.

## Scenarios

- **GIVEN** a Kanban task session in `ModeTask`, **WHEN** the client lists or searches tools, **THEN** `step_complete_kandev` is discoverable without vendor-specific eager-load metadata.
- **GIVEN** a non-Office Kanban workflow step with an agent profile and `auto_advance_requires_signal=true`, **WHEN** its task resolves the step profile as the runner, **THEN** the task remains in `ModeTask`, its first-turn context instructs normal discovery of `step_complete_kandev`, and the task-mode catalog contains the tool.
- **GIVEN** an Office task session in `ModeOffice`, **WHEN** the client lists tools, **THEN** `step_complete_kandev` is discoverable.
- **GIVEN** an ungated Office workflow step, **WHEN** its first-turn context is generated, **THEN** the tool remains available but the context does not instruct the agent to call it as the final action.
- **GIVEN** a signal-gated Office workflow step, **WHEN** its first-turn context is generated, **THEN** the context instructs the agent to call `step_complete_kandev` as the final action.
- **GIVEN** a task-mode client has connected to Kandev MCP, **WHEN** its MCP connection drops and reconnects, **THEN** the client can list and call `step_complete_kandev` without another user message.
- **GIVEN** a signal-gated workflow step, **WHEN** the agent finishes without calling the tool, **THEN** the task remains on the current step and no automatic transition runs.
- **GIVEN** a signal-gated workflow step with a configured `move_to_next` move,
  **WHEN** its agent becomes idle without calling the completion tool, **THEN**
  the normal next-step action is visible in task composer surfaces that provide
  that action.
- **GIVEN** an ungated workflow step with the same configured `move_to_next` move,
  **WHEN** its composer is rendered, **THEN** the redundant next-step action is
  not visible because the turn-complete transition can advance automatically.
- **GIVEN** a signal-gated workflow step with a configured `move_to_next` move,
  **WHEN** its agent is busy, **THEN** the next-step action remains hidden until
  the agent returns to an idle state.
- **GIVEN** a signal-gated workflow step with a configured `move_to_next` move
  and a pending clarification, **WHEN** its session is waiting for input,
  **THEN** the standard and passthrough next-step actions remain hidden until
  the clarification is answered or otherwise cleared.
- **GIVEN** the same session's durable pending-action projection is
  `clarification` while its messages are still hydrating, **WHEN** its session
  is waiting for input, **THEN** both composer surfaces keep the next-step
  action hidden until the message-derived or durable clarification barrier
  clears.
- **GIVEN** the same signal-gated workflow step after its clarification barrier
  clears, **WHEN** its session is idle, **THEN** the standard and passthrough
  next-step actions become eligible again.
- **GIVEN** a signal-gated workflow step with a configured `move_to_previous` or
  `move_to_step` move, **WHEN** its composer is rendered, **THEN** the existing
  adjacent-next-step action remains hidden because it cannot submit the
  configured destination.
- **GIVEN** a signal-gated workflow step that also enables explicit user-cancel completion, **WHEN** the user cancels the active turn, **THEN** the configured completion transition may run without `step_complete_kandev` as defined by the cancelled-turn completion policy.
- **GIVEN** a client that displays fully qualified MCP names, **WHEN** it resolves the completion instruction, **THEN** it can associate canonical `step_complete_kandev` with its qualified runtime alias.
- **GIVEN** Claude ACP initializes, **WHEN** the bridge reports its identity, **THEN** Kandev records the reported bridge name and version in diagnostics without constraining package resolution in this feature.

## Out of Scope

- Changing completion-signal persistence or ordinary halt semantics, or
  implementing ADR 0015's planned signal-writing "Mark complete & advance"
  fallback. The ordinary manual task-move action remains distinct from that
  future fallback. Explicit user-cancel behavior is defined separately by the
  cancelled-turn completion spec.
- Adding vendor-specific eager-load metadata; agents are expected to use normal MCP tool discovery.
- Implementing a generic MCP proxy or replacing the ACP bridge.
