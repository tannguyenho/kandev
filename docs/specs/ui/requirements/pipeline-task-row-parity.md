# Pipeline Task Row Parity Requirements

## Overview

Pipeline is the second task-listing view (Display -> view mode "pipeline",
persisted as `kandev.taskListing.view.v1`), rendering one task per row: a title
button, one pill per workflow step, an actions cluster.

The row is a step tracker that has not yet become a task surface. It shows
title, repository name, relative time and session count, omits nearly
everything else the card shows about a task's state, and offers archive and
delete only.

The reason is measurable. Measured 2026-09-01, "New Feature Dev" workflow, 9
visible steps, 1600px window: each step costs a 130px pill plus a 25px
connector, so nine steps consume 1370px of a 1646px row before the 200px title
and the actions cluster. **There is no room left to put anything in.**
Recovering that width is the enabling change, and the step run scrolling inside
its own lane is where it is recovered. The 200px information column is kept: it
is what holds every row's run to a common starting x. `SwimlaneGraph2Content` also
accepts and discards two `ViewContentProps` members Kanban honors, `onEditTask`
and `onSelectRange`.

The UI system owns this contract: presentation and interaction over task state
the Tasks system already exposes, with no task, workflow, or persistence
contract changing.

## Terminology

- **Board surface:** The width available to the task list after app chrome and
  any preview panel, per [Adaptive Kanban](adaptive-kanban.md), not viewport
  width.
- **Step run:** The ordered step markers after the information column.
- **Current step:** The step whose id equals the task's `workflowStepId`. A
  task whose `workflowStepId` is empty has none.
- **Collapsed marker:** Historical term, superseded 2026-09-03: every step
  marker renders its own labelled pill, past, current and future alike.
- **Actions cluster:** The trailing group holding the task menu trigger. Card
  09404bae pins it to the trailing edge, which this contract assumes.
- **Disclosure surface:** The hover/focus popover on the row title.
- **Parity of information, not of layout:** Every fact the Kanban card shows is
  reachable from the row, but the row keeps its own layout and moves what does
  not fit to the disclosure surface.


## Requirements

### REQ-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001: The step run never grows the row

**Revision (2026-09-03):** This requirement originally collapsed every
non-current step to a 12px unlabelled marker so a nine-step run fit with no
scrolling. Design review found that illegible: a person could not tell which
steps existed without hovering each one. Every step now keeps its own labelled
pill, and the no-growth guarantee comes from scrolling the step run instead,
anchored so the current pill stays in view. AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.1/.3/.8/.9
reflect this revision.

**Intent:** A row that grows with the workflow's step count pushes the actions
cluster off the board surface.

**User story:** As a person scanning a nine-step workflow, I want to see every
step's name at a glance, with the row never growing wider than the board.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.1:** Every step marker in the run renders with a
  visible text label, including past and future steps, not only the current
  one.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.2:** Past and future step pills remain visually
  distinct from each other and from the current step's pill.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.3:** At a 1280px board surface with 9 workflow
  steps, the row element's own width never exceeds the task list's
  `clientWidth` and the actions cluster's right edge falls within the board
  surface, regardless of step count. The step run may scroll horizontally
  (AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.8) when it does not fit; the row sizes to the list,
  not to its own content, and carries no max-content minimum width, which is
  what puts the cluster off-screen today.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.4:** Every step's title is reachable from the row
  whenever the row's menus are available: inline on its own pill, and without a
  pointer through the menu's move-to-step entries, which list every step and
  mark the current one. Multi-select suppresses both menus
  (AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-002.3, 002.8), suspending the pointer-free route until
  exited, matching the Kanban card.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.5:** Past and future step pills are not individually
  focusable, so a row's tab stop count does not grow with step count.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.6:** The row exposes its position as accessible text
  naming the current step title and its ordinal in the visible run.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.7:** The previous-step and next-step move controls
  continue to appear on hover or focus of the current step, each naming its
  destination step in a visible tooltip. At the first displayed step the
  previous-step control is absent, at the last the next-step control is; neither
  wraps, and their absence does not shift the run.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.8:** When the step run's full-pill width exceeds the
  space available to it, the run scrolls horizontally rather than growing the
  row or shrinking pills below their fixed size. The run is kept scrolled so
  the current step's pill stays within the visible lane by default; only past
  steps are permitted to scroll out of view, never the current or (space
  permitting) next steps.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.9:** Past and future step pills are not a click
  target for moving the task; movement stays on the move controls and
  move-to menu.

### REQ-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-002: The row offers the full task menu

**Intent:** The row offers Archive and Delete only, so the view cannot be a
primary board.

**User story:** As a person working in pipeline view, I want the same task
actions the Kanban card offers.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-002.1:** The row's menu trigger opens a menu whose
  entries match the Kanban card's dropdown in identity, order, labels,
  enablement, and destructive styling for the same task and workspace.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-002.2:** The menu offers edit, move to step, send to
  workflow, link (pull request, issue, merge request, Jira, Linear, Sentry),
  plugin actions, archive, detach from parent, and delete, each under the card's
  availability conditions.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-002.3:** Right-clicking anywhere on the row that is not
  an interactive control opens a context menu with the same entries, on desktop
  pointers only. Multi-select suppresses it, matching the Kanban card.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-002.4:** Menu entries for both surfaces come from a
  single shared source, so a change to an entry's label, order, icon or
  enablement appears in both without a second edit.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-002.5:** Confirmation and link dialogs opened from the
  row behave as from the Kanban card, including the archive and detach
  confirmations and focus return.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-002.6:** The Kanban card's rendered menu and inline
  status output are unchanged by this work, except for the disclosure change
  AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-004.4 requires. "Unchanged" is judged against the card at
  this contract's base commit, over the fixture matrix and comparison fields
  the design's Observability section names.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-002.7:** Selecting a menu entry does not also trigger
  the row's click, preview, navigation, or selection behavior.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-002.8:** In multi-select mode the actions cluster is
  absent, matching the Kanban card; its absence does not shift the step run.

### REQ-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003: Inline status parity

**Intent:** A row showing a blocked task with no blocked indication reads as
progressing. These are the facts a person scans a board for, so they belong on
the row.

**User story:** As a person scanning many rows, I want change-request and
blocking state visible without hovering.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.1:** The row shows the pull request, merge request,
  and registered change-request status indicators, each rendering nothing
  without such an association.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.2:** The row shows the blocked indicator when the
  task is blocked, distinguishing a failed predecessor from merely pending
  ones.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.3:** The row shows the queued-for-step indicator
  when the task is queued for a step.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.4:** The row shows the approval-required and
  changes-requested review states under the Kanban card's conditions.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.5:** The row shows the active subagent count when it
  exceeds zero, and the remote-cloud executor indicator when the task runs on
  one.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.6:** The row renders the `task-card-indicators`
  plugin slot with the slot props the Kanban card supplies, and nothing extra
  when it has no contribution. It does not render `task-card-tags`: that slot
  holds its own row on the card, and seating it on a single-line row means
  cropping an arbitrary contribution into a half-legible sliver, which reads
  worse than its absence.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.7:** The row shows repository chips with full paths
  on hover, using the Kanban card's resolution, ordering, visible count, and
  overflow behavior.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.8:** The row renders in one fixed left-to-right
  order: the information column (AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.12), the step run, the
  inline status strip, then the actions cluster. Within the strip the order is
  pull request, merge request, registered change request, plugin indicators,
  blocked, queued for step, review state, subagent count, remote executor. An
  element with nothing to show occupies no width. The strip's members render in
  the same relative order as on the Kanban card; what differs is where each
  surface seats the strip as a whole. Session count and relative updated time
  belong to the column, not the strip: the shared badges block suppresses its
  own session count so the row shows one, and relative time has no card
  counterpart at all. The row's needs-attention edge treatment is not a member
  of this order; it is preserved by the restructure rather than lost with the
  button carrying it today.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.9:** Every row is one task row of the same height,
  whatever status elements it carries and whether or not it has a repository.

- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.10:** No status element is nested inside another
  element's activation target, so the row contains no interactive control inside
  another interactive control.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.11:** When the AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.8 members
  other than the step run exceed the available width, the row yields width in a
  fixed order: first each line of the information column truncates within the
  column's own fixed width, then the step run scrolls per
  AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.8, then, both exhausted, the row's content between the
  information column and the actions cluster scrolls horizontally while that
  cluster stays pinned and reachable. That scroll is the terminus: the row never
  wraps, clips an indicator, or drops a plugin contribution. A row carries at
  most one horizontally scrolling region at a time: at the second stage it spans
  the step run alone, at the terminus that same region widens to span the run
  and the strip together, and two such regions are never nested nor placed side
  by side, which is what keeps the stages distinguishable. The region reserves
  no scrollbar height, so row height is identical at every stage, including on
  platforms rendering non-overlay scrollbars. Repository chips are not a yield
  stage; they render at the card's fixed visible count at every width
  (AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.7).
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.12:** The row opens with an information column of
  one fixed width, identical on every row, carrying the task title, its
  repository chips, its relative updated time and its session count at more
  than zero sessions. Each line truncates within the column rather than widening
  it. The column is not a yield stage: it neither grows for a long title nor
  shrinks for a busy row.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.13:** Every row's step run begins at the same
  horizontal position, whatever that row's own title length, repository, or
  status indicators are. A run whose start moves row to row stops reading as one
  shared track down the board, which is what the view is for.

### REQ-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-004: Disclosure parity on hover

**Intent:** The row truncates its title at 200px with no tooltip and no `title`
attribute, so a truncated title is unrecoverable.

**User story:** As a person whose task titles are longer than the column, I
want to read the whole title and its context without leaving the board.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-004.1:** Hovering or keyboard-focusing the row title
  opens a disclosure surface showing the task's full untruncated title.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-004.2:** The disclosure surface shows the task
  description, the parent-task relationship when the task is a subtask, and its
  subtasks, each when present.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-004.3:** The disclosure surface opens when the task has a
  description, a parent, or at least one subtask, or when its title is visually
  truncated at its rendered width, measured on that surface's own title
  element, and not otherwise. A bare short-titled task gains no popover on
  either surface.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-004.4:** The Kanban card uses the same disclosure surface
  and gains the same content, so the two views do not diverge.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-004.5:** Opening the disclosure surface does not
  preview, navigate, select, or move the task.

### REQ-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005: Deterministic and resilient row behavior

**Intent:** Row order, in-flight actions, and out-of-band updates are
unspecified, leaving each to be invented at implementation.

**User story:** As a person watching a live board, I want rows to hold a stable
order and survive concurrent updates.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.1:** Rows are ordered by the index of the task's step
  within the displayed steps ascending, then by the task's `position` ascending
  treating an absent position as 0, then by the task's `id` ascending. A task
  with no resolvable current step (AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.6) sorts after every
  task that has one, ordering within that group by the two remaining keys. The
  order is identical for identical inputs regardless of arrival order.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.2:** While a step move for a task is in flight,
  further move requests from the same row are ignored rather than queued, and
  that row's move controls and move-to entries are disabled. The guard is
  row-local: a move from another client or mounted view is a cross-client
  conflict owned by AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.3 and AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.4.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.3:** When a move fails, the row returns to the step
  the server reports and the existing move-error surface reports the failure.
  The row always renders the task's step as the store holds it, so an
  out-of-band change arriving mid-flight is not reverted when the move settles.
  The in-flight guard is presentational: it releases on every terminal outcome,
  and once released the same move may be requested again.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.4:** When the task's step changes out of band while
  its menu or a confirmation dialog is open, the row re-renders at the new step
  and that surface stays open.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.5:** When the task leaves the list while a menu or
  dialog is open, the row and its surfaces unmount without an error.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.6:** When the displayed step list is non-empty and
  the task has no resolvable current step, its `workflowStepId` being empty and
  so matching no displayed step, the row renders every displayed marker in its
  not-yet-reached form plus exactly one labelled marker before them, carrying
  fixed unassigned-step copy rather than a step title, and a not-yet-reached
  connector between that marker and the first displayed step. The row never
  renders zero labelled markers while any step is displayed. That marker carries
  no move controls; the AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-001.6 summary names the unassigned
  state in place of a step title and ordinal, and the move-to-step entries
  remain the route to a step.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.7:** When the displayed step list is empty, the row
  renders its title and actions cluster with no step run and does not error.
  AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.6 does not apply to an empty displayed step list.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.8:** A task with no linked repository, description,
  parent, dependencies, or change-request association renders a row with no
  empty chip, badge, or separator. The one reserved space is the information
  column's repository line, whose height is held whether or not the task has a
  repository, so the board keeps the constant row pitch
  AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-003.9 requires.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.9:** Values scoped to the workspace rather than to a
  task, namely external-link availability and the workspace repository list,
  produce the same result on every row of one list: no two rows rendered
  together disagree about link entries or existing repositories.
- **AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.10:** Shift-clicking a row in multi-select mode
  selects the contiguous range between the last selected and the clicked row in
  the AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.1 order.

## Out of scope

- **Card 09404bae's two defects.** The 3-dots trigger's right edge measured
  x=1982 against a 1600px viewport, so the view's only menu is off-screen, and
  `onPreviewTask` is threaded into `Graph2StepNode` and never read. Both belong
  to **card 09404bae**, which lands first. This contract specifies what goes in
  the cluster, not where it sits.
- **Redesigning the Kanban card.** Kanban's rendered output changes only where
  a criterion says so, at AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-004.4.
- **Mobile and touch pipeline.** `getEffectiveTaskListingView` forces pipeline
  back to kanban on mobile, so pipeline is a desktop surface inheriting the
  existing non-desktop no-ops.
- **Right-to-left layouts.** The five shipped locales are all left-to-right.
- **Drag and drop between steps.** Movement stays on the chevron controls and
  the move-to menu.
- **The List view.** Pipeline only.
- **Empty task titles.** Non-empty by the Tasks contract, so no placeholder is
  specified.
- **A user-configurable row density.** Rejected: it doubles the layout surface
  to test and no measured defect needs it.
- **Backend, task, workflow, WIP-limit, preview contracts.** Unchanged.
- **Adding members to `ViewContentProps`.** Values the row needs that the view
  contract does not carry, the workspace id, the workspace repository list, and
  external-link availability, are read from the store as the plugin slots do.
  This bars new members, not correcting an existing member's declared type to
  match its real call site.
- **Naming a hidden step on the row.** An earlier revision had
  AC-UI-PIPELINE-ROW-005.6 render a hidden current step's own title, needing the
  task's pre-remap `workflowStepId` and the unfiltered step set. No task can
  reach a row on a hidden step (design, "Failure and recovery"), so that clause
  is cut; letting hidden steps hold tasks would mean reinstating it.

## Scenarios

Each criterion is directly testable, so this section carries only flows
spanning more than one.

- **GIVEN** a 1280px board surface and a 9-step workflow, **WHEN** a task at
  step 4 renders, **THEN** all nine steps render as labelled pills, the step
  run scrolls internally to keep step 4's pill in view, and the row itself
  never overflows the list.
- **GIVEN** a title longer than the information column, **WHEN** the person
  hovers or focuses it, **THEN** the disclosure surface shows the full title
  plus description, parent, and subtasks where present, and the task is neither
  previewed nor navigated to; **GIVEN** instead a short-titled task with no
  description, parent, or subtasks, **THEN** no surface opens.
- **GIVEN** two rows differing in title length, repository, and status
  indicators, **WHEN** both render, **THEN** their step runs begin at the same
  horizontal position.
