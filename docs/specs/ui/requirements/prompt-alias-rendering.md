# Prompt Alias Rendering Requirements

## Overview

Saved prompts can be referenced in user messages with an `@name` alias. The
transcript already presents recognized aliases as prompt chips, but the same
message content is rendered differently in the anchored last-prompt bar and
Prompt history. Consistent presentation lets users identify referenced prompt
content regardless of which transcript surface they are reading.

## Terminology

- **Saved prompt alias:** An `@name` token recognized by the existing prompt
  mention matcher and corresponding to a saved prompt in the prompt store.
- **Prompt chip:** The transcript's visual representation of a recognized saved
  prompt alias, including its hover preview when content is available.

## Requirements

### REQ-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-001: Consistent saved prompt alias presentation

**Intent:** Show recognized saved prompt aliases consistently across transcript
surfaces without changing the message content sent to agents.

**User story:** As a task reader, I want saved prompt aliases to look the same
in the transcript, pinned last-prompt bar, and Prompt history, so that I can
recognize referenced prompts while reviewing any surface.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-001.1:** When a user message contains an alias matching a
  saved prompt, the transcript, anchored last-prompt bar, and Prompt history
  shall render that alias as the same prompt chip, including its saved-prompt
  name metadata and hover preview when the saved prompt has content.
- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-001.2:** When a user message contains an unrecognized
  `@` token, each surface shall leave it as ordinary text using the existing
  prompt-name matching rules; rendering shall not invent a chip for an unknown
  name.
- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-001.3:** Alias chips shall continue to render inside the
  existing Markdown structures supported by the transcript renderer. Rich
  Markdown code spans and link destinations shall remain ordinary rendered
  content, while aliases in link labels may use the chip's visual treatment
  without creating nested interactive controls. The pinned and history surfaces
  shall preserve their current compact, expandable, and scrollable behavior.
- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-001.4:** Updating the saved prompt collection shall update
  alias chip recognition and hover content in mounted pinned or history views;
  the fix shall not alter persisted message text, prompt expansion semantics, or
  the raw-message view.
- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-001.5:** The presentation shall remain available on
  desktop and phone Prompt history surfaces, while preserving the existing
  desktop-only visibility rule for the anchored last-prompt bar.

### REQ-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-002: Editable references in task creation

**Intent:** Identify saved prompt references while users compose a new task.
This extends the reusable alias presentation contract beyond transcript views.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-002.1:** In task creation, recognized references shall
  appear as inline chips with the transcript's color and name treatment.
  This includes presets, restored drafts, pasted text, and completed typed aliases.
  Unknown names shall remain editable text. Recognition shall preserve existing
  name boundaries and Markdown code and link-destination exclusions.
- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-002.2:** Selecting a saved prompt in task creation shall
  insert its `@name` reference instead of its full definition.
  Enter, Tab, pointer, and touch selection shall replace only the active query.
  Selection shall retain editor focus and shall not submit the task.
- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-002.3:** Users shall edit text around chips, remove an
  individual reference, and undo or redo these edits without losing adjacent text.
  Copy, paste, draft storage, and task submission shall retain plain-text aliases,
  whitespace, and line breaks. Chip markup shall not enter the saved description.
- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-002.4:** A chip shall expose the current saved definition
  through pointer and keyboard activation on desktop and through a tap on touch devices.
  Preview dismissal shall preserve the draft and return focus to the composer.
  Users shall have a visible removal action that removes only the selected occurrence.
- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-002.5:** Prompt loading or lookup failure shall not block
  editing or submission. Store updates shall refresh recognition and previews without
  changing draft text or selection. Deleted or renamed references shall become ordinary text.
- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-002.6:** Phone creation shall retain its full-height form
  and reachable footer. Chips shall wrap within the editor without document horizontal overflow.
  Touch preview and removal controls shall have hit targets of at least 44px.
  Long preview content shall scroll within its safe-area-aware drawer.
- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-002.7:** Attachments, enhancement, voice insertion, plugin
  insertion, launch preview, cancellation, and retry shall preserve their existing task-creation behavior.
  New Agent, task editing, and other prompt editors shall retain their existing insertion behavior.
  Backend expansion authority and passthrough exclusions shall remain unchanged.


- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-002.8:** On fine-pointer desktop at the standard root font,
  editable reference chips shall have a 24px outer height and a 12px label.
  One green background and border shall enclose the label and always-visible
  removal control. The control shall show hover and keyboard-focus feedback.
  Chip layout shall add no separate row margin around the reference.
- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-002.9:** Long reference names shall truncate inside the
  available editor width while the removal control remains fully visible.
  The full name shall remain accessible. Multiple chips shall wrap as whole
  units without horizontal document overflow or overlapping action targets.
- **AC-UI-PROMPT-ALIAS-002.10:** On phones and coarse-pointer devices, preview
  and removal targets shall each measure at least 44px in both dimensions.
  Both controls shall stay inside the same chip border with distinct hit areas.
  Activating removal shall not open a preview or submit the form.
  Desktop transcript, pinned-prompt, and history chip sizing shall remain unchanged.

## Out of scope

- Changing prompt alias parsing, matching, expansion depth, or agent delivery.
- Changing saved prompt persistence, prompt CRUD, or message APIs.
- Adding prompt numbers, navigation behavior, or new Markdown features.
- Rendering aliases in passthrough, comments, plans, or unrelated editors.
