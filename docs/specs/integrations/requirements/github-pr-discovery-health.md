# GitHub PR discovery health requirements

## Overview

Users need task PR discovery to work and its failures to remain visible.
Reported quota is not proof that a PR request succeeded.
Integrations owns this contract because it owns GitHub discovery, credentials,
and provider status. Task and UI systems consume its results.

## Requirements

### REQ-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-001: Discover task pull requests

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-001.1:** When exactly one eligible open
  PR matches a watched branch, a successful discovery shall associate that PR
  with the owning task and expose it to task consumers.
- **AC-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-001.2:** Discovery shall preserve the
  target repository and head repository identities for same-repository and
  fork PRs. Missing head repository data shall not invent an identity.
- **AC-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-001.3:** A rejected provider query shall
  not be treated as a successful search with no PR. Existing associations and
  explicit unlink decisions shall remain intact.
- **AC-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-001.4:** For every unchanged attached
  repository and branch, repeated watch reconciliation shall preserve its
  discovery target independently of sibling branches and task-group ownership.
  A confirmed rename may update that target; missing or ambiguous branch
  information shall not redirect it to a sibling target.

### REQ-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-HEALTH-001: Explain discovery failures

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-HEALTH-001.1:** When PR discovery fails,
  workspace integration settings shall show the failed operation, failure
  category, and last failure time independently of reported quota.
- **AC-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-HEALTH-001.2:** Refreshing quota, opening
  its disclosure, or successfully checking authentication shall not clear a
  PR discovery failure. Quota values may update while the failure stays visible.
- **AC-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-HEALTH-001.3:** A later successful
  discovery of the affected repository and branch shall clear that failure.
  Success that started before the failure shall not clear it. If at least one
  discovery remains failed, settings shall retain a degraded indication.
- **AC-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-HEALTH-001.4:** Rate-limited discovery
  shall wait until its retry deadline before another automatic or manual
  attempt. Quota refresh shall not bypass this pause. A retry becoming due
  shall not itself report recovery.
- **AC-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-HEALTH-001.5:** Failures shall remain
  isolated by workspace connection and credential generation. Switching
  workspace or replacing credentials shall not expose stale failures from
  the previous context.
- **AC-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-HEALTH-001.6:** Desktop and phone users
  shall see the same failure and quota information. The phone details shall
  use a touch-accessible drawer, readable wrapping, and no page overflow.
- **AC-INTEGRATIONS-GITHUB-PR-DISCOVERY-HEALTH-001.7:** An invalid query shall
  be identified separately from a quota failure. It shall not trigger an
  immediate fallback using the same invalid query or an automatic retry more
  often than once per minute for that discovery target.

## Exclusions

No new credentials, automatic PR creation, inferred PR links from chat, changed
fork eligibility, unlink behavior, or task/workflow transitions. No promise
that the quota endpoint explains all provider throttling. Failure history is
runtime status, not a permanent incident archive.
