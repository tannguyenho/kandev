# Task 02: Send late answers as new messages

## Summary

Let users answer earlier human clarification questions through ordinary messages.
Preserve answers when tool submission receives a recognized inactive result.
This revises PR #3799's removal-only behavior without reopening tool authority.

## In scope

- Transcript entry point and inline late-answer form on desktop and phone.
- A shared question/answer formatter and adapter to ordinary message admission.
- Recognized inactive-answer fallback, draft retention, stable retry identity,
  correct session targeting, and explicit sent/queued feedback.
- Existing live-waiter and detached-current-turn paths remain operational.
- Localization in all supported catalogs and focused public documentation.

## Out of scope

Backend tool-response authority changes, replacement sessions, forced interruption,
Inbox History mutations, permission approvals, and parent-agent question routing.
Do not make historical questions count as pending workflow input.

## Acceptance

1. A user can answer an earlier unanswered question from its conversation.
   Question prompts, selected labels, and custom text reach ordinary admission
   for the source task/session. Idle, busy, and unavailable cases match chat.
2. Recognized inactive results preserve affirmative answers for the same path.
   Close sends nothing. Unknown conflicts and uncertain tool transport results
   retain the existing response retry path instead of sending a duplicate message.
3. Failures retain drafts; retries reuse admission identity. Navigation and
   newer questions cannot redirect delivery or lose a pending admission.
   Desktop and phone distinguish queued admission from sent messages.

## Technical approach

Extend `useClarificationGroup` with a typed late-message callback/outcome.
Capture the submitted questions and answers before awaiting the response.
Do not emit a destructive host outcome before fallback admission settles.
Keep an admission owner mounted independently of the expiring overlay, so
its draft and stable request ID survive cache updates and close/reopen cycles.

Reuse `useMessageHandler`, `deriveSessionInputMode`, and `useQueue` through
one shared adapter. Do not issue raw prompt or queue requests from components.
Read the source session's latest state; an obsolete question must not force
`hasPendingClarification=true`. A separate current question keeps its barrier.
Retain existing request-generation and per-row version fences.

Add a shared formatter with focused tests. Render source questions and answers
as ordinary user text, not a privileged system marker. Never derive the target
from global active selection after asynchronous work.

`ClarificationRequestMessage` exposes the history action for human questions
that are no longer operational. Reuse the existing question form with explicit
new-message mode and Close. The message renderer supplies needed conversation
context. Read-only surfaces navigate to that conversation; the Inbox History
read path remains free of mutations. Existing authenticated message admission
owns access and availability checks.

## ASCII UI preview

UI-02: Shared desktop and phone inline flow, from transcript history.

```text
[Earlier question                                  ]
[Answer as new message                             ]
       opens:
[Question and answer choices                       ]
[Custom answer                                     ]
[Close]                       [Send as new message  ]
[Failure: draft retained, Retry available           ]
```

See [the combined preview](plan.md#revised-contract-and-delivery-scope).
Reuse inline clarification controls and existing scroll ownership. Keep phone
safe areas and 44px coarse-pointer targets. Return focus to opener on Close.
Localize action and sent/queued feedback. Map to criteria `.4` through `.9`.

## Tests and verification

Deterministic coverage covers both entry points: inactive response after an
answer submission, and direct historical-question answering. The shared
message-handler tests cover source-session barriers, busy queue admission,
unavailable transport, and stable caller-owned retry IDs. Overlay and group
tests cover answer retention, retry feedback, current-question exclusion,
timeout/error separation, and zero-message Close behavior. Existing
live-answer and Skip tests stay green.

Add `late answer` cases to desktop/mobile clarification browser files. Assert
actual admitted message or queue content with the original question and answers,
not only disappearance of the overlay. A failed admission preserves the form.

Run these commands from the repository root during implementation, not design:

```bash
(cd apps && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec vitest run hooks/domains/session/use-clarification-group.test.ts hooks/domains/session/use-clarification-group.regressions.test.ts hooks/domains/session/use-clarification-group.timeout.test.ts hooks/use-message-handler.test.ts hooks/domains/session/session-input-mode.test.ts components/task/chat/clarification-input-overlay.test.tsx components/task/chat/messages/clarification-request-message.test.tsx)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run i18n:zh-hant && pnpm run i18n:check)
make build-web
make build-backend
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --no-build --project chromium -- tests/chat/clarification.spec.ts --grep 'late answer')
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --no-build --project mobile-chrome -- tests/chat/mobile-clarification.spec.ts --grep 'late answer')
python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
git diff --check
```

Include any newly extracted helper test files in the exact Vitest command
before implementation completion. Record real results and rendered UI checks.

## Files likely touched

- `apps/web/hooks/domains/session/use-clarification-group.ts` and its tests.
- `apps/web/hooks/use-message-handler.ts` and its existing tests if adaptation is needed.
- `apps/web/components/task/chat/clarification-input-overlay.tsx` and its tests.
- `apps/web/components/task/chat/messages/clarification-request-message.tsx` and its tests.
- `apps/web/components/task/chat/message-renderer.tsx`.
- Task chat, Quick Chat, and run-transcript host callback wiring as required.
- `apps/web/e2e/tests/chat/clarification.spec.ts`.
- `apps/web/e2e/tests/chat/mobile-clarification.spec.ts`.

- `docs/public/tasks-and-workflows.md`.

## Dependencies

Task 01, PR #3799 head `6edc7320dd`. Re-read its current head before implementation.

## Risks

A tool failure can be ambiguous. Fall back only on recognized inactive results.
Cache retirement must not unmount the owner of draft/admission state.
Historical content must never become trusted system instructions.
Current-turn authority and Inbox History isolation remain unchanged.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- Updated lifecycle criteria `.4` through `.9`.
- Response-reliability design's inactive-response and late-answer section.
- ADR `2026-09-18-late-clarification-messages`.
- Task 01's completed race and Escape regressions.

## Results

Task 02 is complete. The shared late-answer adapter captures the source task and
session, formats question context with selected labels and custom text as
ordinary user content, and delivers it through the existing message admission
and queue rules. A recognized inactive affirmative response preserves the
answers and uses that same adapter. Close only dismisses the form. Unknown or
ambiguous failures remain on the original retry path.

The transcript action is available for historical unanswered questions, while a
current pending turn does not expose a duplicate answer action. Desktop and
phone use the same inline form with localized sent, queued, and retry feedback.
The source question bundle and client admission ID remain stable across
navigation and remounts. Inbox History remains read-only and continues to link
to the source conversation.

Validation passed:

- Focused Vitest: 8 files, 142 tests.
- TypeScript typecheck, `make build-web`, and `make build-backend`.
- `i18n:check`; changed `task` namespaces converted for `zh-hk` and `zh-tw`.
  The all-locale converter still reports the two unrelated historical
  `workflows.openAgentSettings` residuals.
- E2E: desktop historical late answer, mobile historical late answer, and
  active 409 fallback, 1 test each.
- Documentation catalog validation, full specification lint, targeted Prettier, and
  `git diff --check`.
- PR documentation coverage passed after nesting the late-answer criteria under
  the lifecycle requirement heading.
- Targeted ESLint reported no errors or warnings on changed frontend and E2E
  files.

## Review remediation

The code-review follow-up hardens late admission across the same source task,
session, and clarification bundle. Retry completion now captures and checks the
pending ID, request generation, and submitted bundle before every post-await
state update, cache reconciliation, and outcome callback. A delayed retry from
an older bundle cannot replace the state of a newer bundle or a returned
generation.

Late-message status, draft answers, and client admission identity now live in a
module-owned external record shared by active, transcript, and Inbox hosts.
When the source session or message cache is absent, the adapter hydrates them
through the existing session APIs before ordinary send, steer, or queue
admission derives its input mode. The regression coverage includes delayed
failure across unmount/remount, active-to-transcript state sharing, missing
Inbox caches, and A→B and A→B→A delayed retry races.

This review was code-only by instruction. No local builds, typechecks, unit
tests, browser tests, or E2E tests were run for the remediation. The normal
commit hooks and `git diff --check` remain the applicable local checks.
