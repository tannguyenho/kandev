# Task 01: Synchronize Toast Theme at Mount

## Summary

Correct the missed initial theme change in the shared Sonner wrapper. Add a
real mount regression and prove a plugin success notification uses the
resolved palette on desktop and mobile.

## In scope

- Component tests for initially unthemed documents, preference precedence,
  live preview/discard/system changes, cleanup, and explicit caller overrides.
- Initial document-theme synchronization in the shared observer effect.
- Focused desktop/mobile browser tests and mobile screenshot inspection.

## Out of scope

- Plugin backend, notification delivery, layout, localization, or new palettes.
- Replacing the document-theme boundary or the existing toast APIs.

## Acceptance

1. The saved-dark and system-dark cold-load regressions fail before the
   correction with root `dark` and `data-sonner-theme="light"`, then pass.
2. The shared wrapper preserves live theme updates, observer cleanup, caller
   overrides, notification identity/content, and provider layout ordering.
3. Production-build Chromium and Pixel 5 checks confirm actual success-toast
   colors from the plugin install UI; mobile screenshot and containment checks
   pass, and existing mobile theme-toggle behavior stays green.

## Verification

Fresh-worktree prerequisite, from the repository root:

```bash
cd apps && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Run RED component and browser regressions before the production edit; repeat
afterward for GREEN. From `apps/web`:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run components/theme/sonner-theme.test.tsx components/theme/app-theme.test.tsx
pnpm e2e:run --project chromium tests/settings/toast-theme.spec.ts -- --retries=0
pnpm e2e:run --project mobile-chrome tests/settings/mobile-toast-theme.spec.ts tests/kanban/mobile-menu-theme-toggle.spec.ts -- --retries=0
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm exec eslint components/theme/sonner-theme.test.tsx e2e/helpers/toast-theme.ts e2e/tests/settings/toast-theme.spec.ts e2e/tests/settings/mobile-toast-theme.spec.ts
pnpm --dir .. exec node web/node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js --config web/eslint.config.mjs --max-warnings 0 packages/ui/src/sonner.tsx
pnpm exec prettier --check ../packages/ui/src/sonner.tsx components/theme/sonner-theme.test.tsx e2e/helpers/toast-theme.ts e2e/tests/settings/toast-theme.spec.ts e2e/tests/settings/mobile-toast-theme.spec.ts
```

The shared UI package has no separate lint script. Its ESLint command runs
from `apps/` with the web configuration explicitly selected so the production
file is inside ESLint's base directory and is not silently ignored.

Use the managed runner's build and cleanup. Confirm test discovery in both
projects and inspect the captured mobile notification. Use installed Sonner's
`data-sonner-theme` attribute and real computed palette colors. Do not change
timeouts or preload the desired root class to satisfy the regression.

## Files likely touched

- `apps/packages/ui/src/sonner.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/theme/sonner-theme.test.tsx` (new)
- `apps/web/e2e/helpers/toast-theme.ts` (new)
- `apps/web/e2e/tests/settings/toast-theme.spec.ts` (new)
- `apps/web/e2e/tests/settings/mobile-toast-theme.spec.ts` (new)
- This work order and `plan.md` for status and evidence.

## Dependencies

None. Reuse `plugin-test-helpers.ts`, the packaged E2E plugin fixture, and the
existing mobile theme-toggle scenario.

## Risks

The root-class mutation occurs before the passive subscription. Tests that
start with a dark document or depend on development effect replay can pass
without repairing that race. Sonner's themed list is absent until a toast is
emitted, so a missing list is test setup failure, not the expected RED signal.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- [Requirements](../../specs/ui/requirements/toast-theme.md), all criteria.
- [System design](../../specs/ui/system-design/toast-theme.md), theme
  synchronization and responsive verification.
- `apps/web/components/theme/app-theme.test.tsx` for provider setup.
- `apps/web/e2e/tests/settings/mobile-plugin-updates.spec.ts` for the affected
  mobile plugin flow.
- `.agents/skills/tdd/SKILL.md`, `.agents/skills/e2e/SKILL.md`, and
  `.agents/skills/mobile-parity/SKILL.md` for implementation and verification.

## Results

Implemented after the explicit user request on 2026-09-09. The shared wrapper
now reads the document theme immediately after subscribing. Production scope
is one state synchronization call and its ordering comment.

### Red and green evidence

- Component RED: two dark-start failures, nine controls/provider tests passed.
  GREEN: all 11 passed in 4.21 seconds.
- Desktop RED: two dark-start failures and one passing light case. GREEN:
  all three passed in 10.2 seconds.
- Mobile RED: two dark-start failures and three passing controls. GREEN:
  all five passed in 16.5 seconds, including the existing theme-toggle tests.
- Both browser RED runs failed with expected `dark`, received `light` from
  the real notification's `data-sonner-theme` attribute. All GREEN browser
  tests also asserted rendered background, foreground, border, and viewport
  containment. Desktop and mobile dark screenshots were inspected.
- Final web typecheck, targeted ESLint, targeted Prettier, and diff checks
  passed. No new public copy or localization changes were needed.

### Historical browser executions (2026-09-09)

The component, typecheck, web-test ESLint, and Prettier commands in Verification
were run as written. The shared UI ESLint command was added and passed during
PR review on 2026-09-10. The following historical browser commands used a
temporary configuration that has since been removed. For a normal fresh
checkout, use the browser commands in Verification above with the checked-in
Playwright configuration. For a checkout path containing `mobile-`, recreate
the temporary override below before rerunning these historical commands.

```bash
pnpm e2e:run --project chromium tests/settings/toast-theme.spec.ts -- --config e2e/toast-theme-check.config.ts --retries=0
pnpm e2e:run --no-build --project mobile-chrome tests/settings/mobile-toast-theme.spec.ts tests/kanban/mobile-menu-theme-toggle.spec.ts -- --config e2e/toast-theme-check.config.ts --retries=0
```

The desktop run rebuilt the fixed production Vite assets. The mobile run
reused those unchanged artifacts. Backend build cache writes and test-server
ports required sandbox escalation, which was approved.

### Workspace-path discovery workaround

The default Chromium project's `/mobile-.*\.spec\.ts/` exclusion also matches
this checkout's parent directory, `on-mobile-notificati_ydji1lsa`, causing
`No tests found` before collection. A temporary configuration imported the
normal Playwright configuration and changed only the mobile filename filters
to `/[/\\]mobile-[^/\\]*\.spec\.ts$/`. It preserved the remaining project
settings, fixtures, and strict WebSocket checks, and discovered the intended
three desktop and five mobile tests. The temporary file was removed after
verification; the shared repository runner configuration was not changed.

To reproduce that workaround, save this as `apps/web/e2e/toast-theme-check.config.ts`,
run the historical browser commands above, then remove the temporary file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";
import base from "./playwright.config";

const mobileFilename = /[/\\]mobile-[^/\\]*\.spec\.ts$/;

export default defineConfig({
  ...base,
  projects: base.projects?.map((project) => ({
    ...project,
    ...(project.name === "mobile-chrome" ? { testMatch: mobileFilename } : {}),
    ...(Array.isArray(project.testIgnore)
      ? {
          testIgnore: project.testIgnore.map((pattern) =>
            String(pattern) === String(/mobile-.*\.spec\.ts/)
              ? mobileFilename
              : pattern,
          ),
        }
      : {}),
  })),
});
```

The first browser setup attempt also corrected its expected fixture title to
the manifest's `Kandev E2E Fixture Plugin` before collecting valid RED evidence.

### Cleanup and artifacts

The managed runner tore down its test backends and browsers. The temporary
Playwright override was removed, and screenshots were retained in
`/tmp/kandev-toast-evidence.Eb9wFU/` for this session. Publication was a later,
separately requested step after the implementation checkpoint.
