# Task 06: Backstop admission compares wave identity

## Summary

Rewrite `ListStuckParents`' staleness arm to compare the parent's current
wave string (computed in SQL) against `runs.wake_wave_string`, add a
wave-member existence gate so a parent with no possible wave is never
listed, and keep a parent-scoped timestamp fallback for pre-upgrade rows
that carry no wave identity at all.

## In scope

- New `internal/db/dialect` helper for an ordered, comma-joined id
  aggregate (SQLite `GROUP_CONCAT` over an ordered subquery; PostgreSQL
  `string_agg(... ORDER BY ...)`), added beside `JSONExtract`.
- `ListStuckParents`: a wave-string CTE column
  (`p.id || '|' || COALESCE(<helper>, '')`) over the wave-member predicate.
- A new `EXISTS` gate (wave-member predicate) beside the existing
  archived-only `EXISTS`, removing a parent with no wave members from
  candidacy (AC-...-003.9). Additive and narrowing only.
- Rewrite the second `NOT EXISTS` arm into three clauses: queued/claimed
  blocks unconditionally; a terminal run whose `wake_wave_string` matches
  the parent's current one blocks; only when the parent has **no**
  `task_children_completed` run with `wake_wave_key <> ''` at all does the
  existing `requested_at >= newest_child_updated_at` timestamp rule apply
  (evaluated once per parent, not per row — AC-...-003.6).

## Out of scope

- The first `NOT EXISTS`/receipt-comparison arm (unchanged — receipts stay
  state-inclusive, AC-...-004.6).
- Porting this query's existing `json_extract`/unbranched `GROUP_CONCAT` to
  dialect form (`53c24173` — do not widen or close that gap here; only the
  new wave-string fragment is dialect-branched).
- The whole-second comparison in the queued-or-claimed arm (`b7e29d7c`).

## Acceptance

- A parent with a delivered, unchanged wave is not a candidate; a
  non-state child edit after delivery does not make it one; a real
  wave-member change does.
- A parent whose only children are archived/ephemeral/automation-origin is
  never listed.
- A parent with a pre-upgrade terminal run (`wake_wave_key = ''`) is judged
  by the timestamp rule; once any keyed run exists for that parent, the
  timestamp rule is never consulted for it again, even for an older
  pre-upgrade row on the same parent.
- A failed/cancelled run whose wave string matches the current one keeps
  blocking across an unrelated child edit and is unblocked only by a
  wave-member change.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend
go test ./internal/db/dialect/... -run TestOrderedIDConcat -v
go test ./internal/office/repository/sqlite/... -run TestListStuckParents -v
KANDEV_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN=... go test ./internal/office/repository/sqlite/... -run TestListStuckParents -v
```

## Files likely touched

- `internal/db/dialect/json.go` (or a new file beside it for the aggregate
  helper, if it doesn't fit `json.go`'s theme)
- `internal/db/dialect/dialect_test.go`
- `internal/office/repository/sqlite/wake_receipts.go`
- `internal/office/repository/sqlite/wake_receipts_test.go`

## Dependencies

Task 01 (wave-member predicate, matched exactly), Task 02 (`wake_wave_key`/
`wake_wave_string` columns must exist to query against).

## Risks

- **Ordering divergence between Go and PostgreSQL collation** — the
  requirements' AC-...-001.13 names this as a silent, PostgreSQL-only
  failure mode. The gated Postgres test must assert byte-identical ordering
  with a fixture using real UUID-shaped ids, not sequential test ids that
  would happen to sort the same everywhere.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- System design: "Backstop admission" section in full, including its
  worked SQL fragments.
- `internal/office/repository/sqlite/wake_receipts.go` (current
  `ListStuckParents`, `child_set_key` aggregate idiom to mirror for the new
  wave-string aggregate).
- `internal/db/dialect/json.go` (signature/doc-comment style to match).

## Results

Done, in `feat(office): compare wave identity in the backstop reconciler`.

`internal/db/dialect/aggregate.go` (new file, not `json.go` — a distinct
aggregate-vs-extraction theme) adds `OrderedIDConcat(driver, where string)
string`, hardcoded to `tasks.id` per "simplest implementation that fully
meets the current requirement" rather than a generic group-concat builder.
SQLite orders via an `ORDER BY` inside the `GROUP_CONCAT` subquery;
PostgreSQL via `string_agg(... ORDER BY ...)` in the aggregate call itself.
`TestOrderedIDConcat_FragmentShape` checks both dialects' exact fragment
text; `TestOrderedIDConcat_SQLite_OrdersAscendingByID` and its
`KANDEV_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`-gated Postgres twin insert UUID-shaped ids out
of order and assert the concatenated result is byte-identical and
ascending across both dialects, per the Risks section's collation-drift
warning.

`ListStuckParents` gained a `wave_string` CTE column
(`p.id || '|' || COALESCE(OrderedIDConcat(...), '')`) over the wave-member
predicate (not archived, not ephemeral, not automation-origin — matching
`ListWaveMembers`), plus a second `EXISTS` gate applying that same
predicate to remove parents with no possible wave from candidacy
(AC-...-003.9), added beside — not replacing — the existing archived-only
`EXISTS`. The second `NOT EXISTS` arm is now: queued/claimed blocks
unconditionally; a terminal run whose `wake_wave_string` matches the
parent's current one blocks (across any unrelated, non-wave-member child
edit, unblocked only by a genuine wave-member change); a separate
`AND (EXISTS(...) OR NOT EXISTS(...))` clause keeps the pre-upgrade
timestamp fallback but scopes it to the parent as a whole
(`wake_wave_key <> ''` for *any* row for that parent, any status, any
wave), not per-row — so a parent's first wave-keyed run retires the
timestamp rule for it permanently, even against an older, still-recent
pre-upgrade row for the same parent (AC-...-003.6).

New tests in `wake_receipts_wave_identity_test.go`:
`TestListStuckParents_WaveMatchBlocksAcrossNonMemberChildEdit_UnblockedOnWaveMemberChange`
(table-driven over finished/failed/cancelled — delivered-unchanged-wave not
a candidate, an automation-origin child completing doesn't unblock it, a
real wave-member joining does),
`TestListStuckParents_ExcludesParentWithOnlyNonWaveMemberChildren`
(ephemeral-only, automation-origin-only, and mixed non-member-only parents
are all excluded, with a control candidate), and
`TestListStuckParents_KeyedRunRetiresTimestampFallbackForParent` (a recent
pre-upgrade terminal run that would otherwise still block under the
timestamp rule is bypassed once any wave-keyed run — even for an unrelated,
stale wave — exists for the parent).

All 8 pre-existing `TestListStuckParents_*` tests (and their subtests)
pass unmodified, confirming the rewrite is backward-compatible with every
scenario that predates wave identity (their fixture runs never set
`wake_wave_key`, so they exercise the compatibility/timestamp-fallback
path exactly as before).

`go build ./...`, `go test ./internal/office/repository/sqlite/...
./internal/db/dialect/...` (full packages), and `golangci-lint run
./internal/office/repository/sqlite/... ./internal/db/dialect/...
--new-from-rev=cd78236315f28982848de4938d56f7722c7f632f` all clean. The
gated `TestOrderedIDConcat_Postgres_OrdersAscendingByID` skips on this
runner (no `KANDEV_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`), consistent with not provisioning
Docker/Postgres for this card.
