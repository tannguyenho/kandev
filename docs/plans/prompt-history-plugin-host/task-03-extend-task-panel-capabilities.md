# Task 03: Extend Generic Task Panel Capabilities


## Replacement scope, 2026-09-16

The [conversation storage replacement](../conversation-storage-replacement/plan.md) owns the next implementation.
This file preserves historical scope and results. Do not execute its durable replay mechanics as new work.
The replacement work orders preserve public behavior and provide new source-reconciliation, upgrade, and E2E evidence.


## Scope

Extend the existing generic task-panel contribution rather than adding prompt-history-specific host branches. Add localized title resolution, typed visibility context, session kind, and a generation-bound native message-navigation capability on desktop and mobile.

## Acceptance

- Desktop add-panel menus, mobile Panels picker, live tabs, restored layouts, and layout previews consume the single reactive host resolver `resolveTaskPanelTitle(registration, i18n)` with the literal title fallback; locale changes update open dockview `api.title` without changing panel identity.
- `visible(context)` receives no private state and is applied consistently to desktop and mobile choices; omission preserves existing visibility. Predicate exceptions are caught by the contribution boundary, logged with plugin/panel identity, and treated as hidden without affecting other entries.
- `PluginTaskPanel` passes current context, injects the Host-created panel-scoped conversation history handle, and revokes the prior navigation/history capabilities on any plugin/panel/task/session/presentation identity change or unmount.
- Desktop uses `scrollTranscriptToMessage`; mobile retains `MobileSessionLayout`'s local scroll target and switches to Chat. Neither path moves mobile state into global Zustand.
- Existing plugin panel registration, persistence, lifecycle failure handling, and mobile full-height presentation stay green.
- Saved-layout validation, serializer/restore, layout-editor registration, and plugin-panel removal/drop handling accept `plugin:<pluginId>:<panelKey>` when the plugin is registered, preserve unknown plugin panels as droppable records when it is absent, and refresh titles through the same resolver after late registration or locale changes.

## TDD sequence

1. RED: add registry/component/menu/mobile/layout-editor tests for title fallback/reactivity, saved-layout round-trip, late registration/removal, visibility success/exception, context propagation, accepted/unavailable outcomes, and stale capability revocation.
2. GREEN: add the optional registration fields and inject the scoped adapters through existing renderers.
3. REFACTOR: centralize context/title resolution without adding a prompt-history condition to generic plugin code.

## Likely files

- `apps/web/lib/plugins/registry.ts`
- `apps/web/components/task/plugin-task-panel.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/task/dockview-add-panel-items.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/task/dockview-panel-content.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/task/dockview-shared.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/task/mobile/plugin-panel-picker.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/task/mobile/session-mobile-layout.tsx`
- `apps/web/lib/state/layout-manager/serializer.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/state/layout-manager/panel-titles.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/state/layout-manager/plugin-panels.test.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/state/layout-manager/serializer.test.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/state/layout-manager/panel-titles.test.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/layout/layout-profiles.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/layout/layout-profiles.test.ts`
- focused registry, task-panel, layout, and mobile tests

## Verification

```bash
cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web test -- --run lib/plugins components/task/plugin-task-panel.test.tsx components/task/dockview-add-panel-items.test.tsx components/task/mobile lib/state/layout-manager/serializer.test.ts lib/state/layout-manager/panel-titles.test.ts lib/state/layout-manager/plugin-panels.test.ts lib/layout/layout-profiles.test.ts
cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck
```

Do not register a prompt-history plugin or remove the built-in panel in this task.

## Result

Extended generic task panels with reactive localized titles, typed visibility
context, session kind, independent conversation scope, and revocable native
message navigation. Desktop, restored-layout, layout-editor, mobile picker, and
full-height mobile rendering paths use the shared contracts without a
prompt-history-specific branch.

Verified:

- Focused browser Host and task-panel suite (49 files, 442 tests)
- `cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck`
