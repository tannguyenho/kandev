# Task 05: Prove Prompt-History Plugin Parity


## Replacement scope, 2026-09-16

The [conversation storage replacement](../conversation-storage-replacement/plan.md) owns the next implementation.
This file preserves historical scope and results. Do not execute its durable replay mechanics as new work.
The replacement work orders preserve public behavior and provide new source-reconciliation, upgrade, and E2E evidence.


## Scope

Add a test-only external-style fixture plugin that implements prompt history through `@kandev/plugin-sdk` and the published Host APIs only. Use it to prove the prerequisite boundary; do not ship it as the production plugin or delete core code.

## Acceptance

- The fixture package manifest declares `capabilities.api_read: ["messages"]`, `min_kandev_version: "0.91.1"`, uses a distinct fixture panel ID, and its generated bundle is installed by the existing plugin-package E2E setup.
- It derives newest-first prompt entries, absolute numbering, bounded durations, sender-task marker, expansion, empty/loading/error states, and older-page loading from public DTOs only.
- It uses host UI/i18n/responsive/favorite/mention/navigation contracts and contains no `apps/web` import, `/api/v1` URL, `host.store` access, or raw WS registration.
- Desktop E2E covers panel entry, initial and older pages, live add/update/delete, live turn completion updating duration, localized title/content behavior, favorite highlight, prompt alias preview, and native transcript navigation.
- `mobile-*.spec.ts` Pixel 5 E2E proves the grouped Panels entry, full-height single-scroll surface, 44 px touch controls, older loading, alias drawer, target navigation, and no document horizontal overflow.
- The fixture's turn-completion scenario proves a live completed turn updates the derived duration without retry or remount.
- The fixture's transition controls causally cover message update/delete and turn completion; assertions wait for the control response and then observe the corresponding facade update.
- Existing built-in prompt-history tests and E2E remain unchanged and green because the ordered stream's `legacy-core` adapter projects exactly one legacy notification to existing core handlers; its durable cursor, projection-before-ACK order, event-id/sequence dedupe, reconnect replay, interleaving, and terminal-removal cases are covered. Backend direct message/turn broadcasts are removed rather than duplicated.
- The package build removes the prior generated UI output, then runs the declared fixture source build (`cd apps/web && pnpm run build:e2e-plugin -- --outDir ../../apps/backend/cmd/plugin-fixture/fixture-package/ui`), and packages only after it succeeds. `e2e-plugin-package` depends on the `.PHONY` `e2e-plugin-ui` target, so stale checked-in UI cannot be packaged.
- The E2E runner and CI invoke the exact order `build backend -> build:e2e -> e2e-plugin-ui -> e2e-plugin-package -> install/spec` in host and container modes. Freshness checks hash fixture source/output plus manifest capability, min version, and panel key; the fixture parity spec exercises the production ordered WebSocket protocol, including session removal and reconnect replay. CI uploads `e2e-plugin-identity.json` with the package, every shard/container downloads both, verifies the archive SHA-256 before install, and fails before specs on missing, stale, or schema-mismatched identity.
- `apps/web/package.json` adds the `build:e2e-plugin` script and `apps/web/e2e/fixtures/plugins/prompt-history-plugin/` is its sole source; the script accepts the declared output directory and fails on missing/stale output.
- Host, container, CI, package, and global-setup paths consume one immutable fixture identity at `apps/backend/.build/e2e-plugin-identity.json`, produced by `e2e-plugin-package` after `e2e-plugin-ui` and archive creation, with schema version `2` and `{schemaVersion,pluginId,pluginVersion,bundlePath,sourceHash,generatedOutputHash,manifestHash,archiveSha256,manifestCapability,minKandevVersion,panelKey}`. The archive SHA-256 covers the exact packaged file; every consumer verifies plugin ID/version, bundle path, manifest hash, and archive digest before install or spec execution. `fixture-package/ui/` remains excluded from backend source-mtime checks. Existing generic backend identity remains separate.

## TDD sequence

1. RED: write desktop and mobile fixture-plugin scenarios against the public contract.
2. GREEN: add the smallest fixture bundle/seed/page-object support needed to exercise the Host APIs.
3. REFACTOR: keep test helpers provider-neutral and remove any shortcut into internal state or routes.

## Likely files

- `apps/backend/cmd/plugin-fixture/fixture-package/manifest.yaml` with `capabilities.api_read: ["messages"]`, `min_kandev_version: "0.91.1"`, and a distinct fixture panel identity.
- `apps/web/e2e/scripts/run-e2e.sh` and the owning CI workflow, so host builds call `e2e-plugin-ui` before `e2e-plugin-package` and preserve the same order in container/host modes.
- External-style fixture source under `apps/web/e2e/fixtures/plugins/prompt-history-plugin/`, with a distinct `prompt-history-plugin` panel key and public-SDK-only imports. The backend `e2e-plugin-package` target copies its built UI output into `apps/backend/cmd/plugin-fixture/fixture-package/ui/` before packaging; the generated archive is the only installed artifact.
- `apps/backend/Makefile` and the fixture-package build/copy step, with assertions that the archive contains the manifest capability and fixture bundle/panel key.
- `apps/web/e2e/helpers/api-client.ts`, `apps/backend/internal/office/testharness/routes.go`, and deterministic test-only update/delete/turn-transition control helpers.
- Root `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`, `apps/web/e2e/scripts/run-e2e.sh`, `apps/web/e2e/global-setup.ts`, and `apps/backend/Makefile` all use the same fixture identity path/schema and build order in host and container modes, including upload/download handoff for every shard.
- `apps/web/e2e/global-setup.ts`, package/archive assertions, and shard setup consume the fixture identity, including source/output hashes, manifest capability, minimum version, and panel key; schema-version mismatch fails before specs.
- `apps/web/e2e/README.md` documents the source-build order, `e2e-plugin-ui` prerequisite, identity artifact, and package freshness checks; a stale-invocation check rejects direct package-before-build usage.
- New desktop spec: `apps/web/e2e/tests/plugins/prompt-history-plugin.spec.ts`.
- `apps/web/e2e/helpers/api-client.ts` methods for `PATCH /api/v1/_test/messages/:id`, `DELETE /api/v1/_test/messages/:id`, and `POST /api/v1/_test/turns/:id/complete`.
- New mobile spec: `apps/web/e2e/tests/plugins/mobile-prompt-history-plugin.spec.ts`.
- Shared prompt-history seed/page-object helpers where existing ones already fit.

## Verification

The [recovery E2E matrix](../pr-3588-conversation-recovery/plan.md#e2e-tests)
adds replay, connected core recovery, and expired continuation cases.
Those cases remain pending and supplement the original parity evidence here.

```bash
make -C apps/backend build
cd apps/web && pnpm run build:e2e
make -C apps/backend e2e-plugin-ui
make -C apps/backend e2e-plugin-package
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:raw --project=chromium e2e/tests/plugins/prompt-history-plugin.spec.ts
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:raw --project=mobile-chrome e2e/tests/plugins/mobile-prompt-history-plugin.spec.ts
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:raw --project=chromium e2e/tests/task/prompt-history-panel.spec.ts
```

Use the repository's one-worker/shard guards. Do not package or publish the fixture.

## Result

Added one public-SDK-only fixture source, deterministic source/output and
archive identity checks, response-bounded transition controls, and shared
desktop/mobile parity helpers. CI, host, container, package, and global-setup
paths now consume identity schema version 2 after the required fresh build
order.

Verified:

- `cd apps/web && pnpm run build:e2e`
- `make -C apps/backend e2e-plugin-ui`
- `make -C apps/backend e2e-plugin-package`
- Desktop fixture E2E: 1 passed
- Pixel 5 mobile fixture E2E: 1 passed
- Built-in Prompt History E2E: 2 passed
