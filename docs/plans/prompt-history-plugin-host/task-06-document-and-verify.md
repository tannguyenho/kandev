# Task 06: Document and Verify Host Prerequisites


## Replacement scope, 2026-09-16

The [conversation storage replacement](../conversation-storage-replacement/plan.md) owns the next implementation.
This file preserves historical scope and results. Do not execute its durable replay mechanics as new work.
The replacement work orders preserve public behavior and provide new source-reconciliation, upgrade, and E2E evidence.


## Scope

Finish the public reference/how-to documentation and run the package-level validation matrix. Update artifact statuses/results only after the behavior and docs are proven. Keep external-plugin and core-removal work explicitly deferred.

## Acceptance

- `docs/public/plugins-authoring.md` explains `host.conversation`, task-panel context/navigation, lifecycle cleanup, and a UI-only session-read example.
- `docs/public/plugins-manifest.md` documents `api_read:messages` and required `min_kandev_version: "0.91.1"` for every manifest that declares that resource, covering both Go `Messages().List` and the browser facade, while preserving the admin-action floor. `apps/backend/internal/plugins/manifest/min_version_policy.go` owns one `MinimumMessagesCapabilityVersion` constant and capability-aware predicate used by manifest validation, archive/Inspect, install/sideload, boot/load, fixture, and direct-build tests; it rejects missing/malformed/lower values in dev/E2E and stamped builds and covers missing, lower, equal, and higher values. `docs/plans/plugins/PLUGIN-API.md` remains canonical.
- Public docs distinguish browser Host reads from Go Host `Messages().List` and warn against `host.store`, raw WS payloads, and first-party `/api/v1` URLs.
- The documented route error table is reflected by public SDK retryability and browser tests; inaccessible resources never reveal existence.
- Update `docs/public/websocket-api.md` so its ordinary notification and
  connection-local subscription statements explicitly exclude the Host-only
  prompt-history stream, and link the canonical ordered subscribe/ACK,
  per-consumer identity, replay, and terminal-removal contract.
- Focused and repository checks below pass against fresh generated/build artifacts. The fresh fixture order is backend build, web `build:e2e`, `e2e-plugin-ui`, `e2e-plugin-package`, plugin install, then desktop/mobile/core specs; every root Makefile, runner, CI host path, and container path replaces direct package invocation with this order and consumes identity schema version `2`. The identity includes plugin ID/version, bundle path, source/output hashes, manifest hash, capability, minimum version, panel key, and archive SHA-256; every shard/container verifies the digest before install/spec execution.
- Requirements, design, plan, and work-order statuses/results reflect actual completion; no core prompt-history ownership artifact is retired.

## TDD sequence

1. RED: add/update public-doc validation examples or reference assertions where the repository already tests contract snippets.
2. GREEN: write the smallest public reference/how-to updates and fix only failures caused by this package.
3. REFACTOR: remove duplicate prose and link the canonical contract for exhaustive field definitions.

## Likely files

- `docs/public/plugins-authoring.md`
- `docs/public/plugins-manifest.md`
- `docs/plans/plugins/PLUGIN-API.md`
- this requirements/design/plan package for final status and result records
- `apps/backend/internal/plugins/manifest/min_version_policy.go`, `docs/public/plugins-authoring.md`, `docs/public/plugins-manifest.md`, `docs/plans/plugins/PLUGIN-API.md`, `apps/web/e2e/README.md`, `apps/web/e2e/global-setup.ts`, `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`, `apps/web/e2e/scripts/run-e2e.sh`, and root/backend Makefiles

## Verification

```bash
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
node --test scripts/validate-public-docs.test.mjs
node scripts/validate-public-docs.mjs
cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck
cd apps/web && pnpm run i18n:check && pnpm run i18n:ratchet

```
Do not commit unless the user explicitly authorizes a commit. Do not implement the external plugin, remove core code, or migrate saved layout IDs.

## Current result

Published the browser facade, manifest/version floor, lifecycle, navigation,
and ordered WebSocket guidance while preserving the separate Go Host API and
core ownership. Final status reconciliation is complete.

Verified:

- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`
- Public-doc validator tests: 61 passed; 46 pages validated
- `cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck`
- Frontend i18n checks and ratchet
- Focused browser Host, scope, registry, task-panel, and retention suites
- Backend `golangci-lint run ./...` (0 issues)
- `make -C apps/backend build`
- Fresh fixture desktop/mobile and built-in Prompt History E2E: 4 tests passed

The bounded repository-wide backend test run was attempted with
`go test -p 2 -tags fts5 ./...`; unrelated environment-sensitive failures
remain in agentctl config, update-channel, and invalid metadata tests, along
with temporary disk-quota linker failures. The changed packages passed focused
verification.
