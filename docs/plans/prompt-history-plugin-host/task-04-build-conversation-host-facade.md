# Task 04: Build Browser Conversation Host Facade

## Replacement scope, 2026-09-16

The [conversation storage replacement](../conversation-storage-replacement/plan.md) owns the next implementation.
This file preserves historical scope and results. Do not execute its durable replay mechanics as new work.
The replacement work orders preserve public behavior and provide new source-reconciliation, upgrade, and E2E evidence.


## Scope
Implement `host.conversation` and the curated prompt-mention renderer behind the published SDK types. Own request/subscription races, pagination, lifecycle cleanup, DTO mapping, favorite reactivity, and private custom-prompt access inside the host.

## Acceptance

- Nullable-session hooks return stable empty state, authorized snapshots, bounded older pages, and `PluginConversationError` values whose required `retryable` field follows the 400/401/404 versus authorized-5xx mapping. Each panel scope owns a monotonic `continuation_revision` from sentinel `0`, incremented on query change, retry, and close, over cursor/token/cutoff/fingerprint/generation; renewal and `loadMore` serialize dispatch per scope and CAS-install only matching revisions, atomically commit page plus next cursor/`hasMore`, discard stale responses, and leave state unchanged on failed renewal.
- `loadMore()` resolves to the number of newly projected messages. Concurrent
  calls for one committed continuation join and resolve to the same count;
  exhausted, closed, and terminal handles resolve `0` without network activity.
  Retryable transport or renewal failures reject with `PluginConversationError`
  while preserving committed state; non-retryable query failures also reject
  and remain in `error`. `retry()` starts a fresh snapshot only for a live
  retryable handle.
- Each mounted `PluginTaskPanel` has a Host-owned scope provider with independent cache, consumer identity, and abort controller. `conversation.history` is authoritative; global `host.conversation` resolves only the nearest scope. Unmount or plugin/panel/task/session/generation change aborts work, releases the consumer, and makes the handle return stable empty state without network activity. Two concurrent panels cannot share scope state; wrong IDs are rejected. The loader's per-generation isolated registry/resource ledger is staged without global visibility, rejects duplicate or foreign ownership, atomically swaps contributions at commit, and discards failed stages without partial notifications.
- Subscription readiness precedes snapshot resolution; message and turn start/completion events reconcile deterministically; reconnect reconciles; deletes and session removal cannot be resurrected by queued updates.
- `session.removed` retains projected rows, sets the hook's `removed` state and message `hasMore` to `false`, and makes later reads/retries no-ops without network activity.
- The facade does not initialize or mutate the chat transcript cache and exposes no Kandev HTTP/event/store types.
- `useMessageFavorite` reacts to the existing session-storage store without exposing toggle/store access.
- `host.ui.PromptMentionText` owns custom-prompt loading and native fine/coarse-pointer previews through a minimal public prop shape.
- The facade filters every buffered/live event by exact task/session identity before timestamp or sequence merging; focused tests cover wrong-session and wrong-task payloads. Omitted `taskId` resolves to the panel task before sending, explicit `null` sends as absent `task_id`, and mismatched strings fail without network activity.
- Snapshot tests block the HTTP response while add/update/delete/session-removal events arrive, then assert ordered replay and no resurrection through reconnect.
- Facade integration tests consume the production ordered WebSocket envelope and `session.removed` terminal event; unit tests may use fixtures only for reducer edge cases.
- Every snapshot/live DTO has required `updatedAt`; the facade applies the documented timestamp-less-add/update policy.

- Reconciliation uses event sequence as ordering and fencing authority; `updatedAt` is freshness metadata only, equal or missing timestamps defer to sequence, and buffered events are released only after the snapshot-cutoff commit.

## TDD sequence

1. RED: add hook/runtime tests for null state, authorization errors, readiness race, pagination joining, concurrent renewal/expiry-between-pages, update/delete ordering, turn completion updates, reconnect, stale generations, two concurrent panels, unmount races, failed/overlapping successor staging with no partial notifications, duplicate ownership, lifecycle cleanup, favorites, prompt mentions, and concrete Host-to-SDK assignability.
2. GREEN: implement the plugin-scoped client, hook cache/reconciler, and UI wrapper in the Host builder.
3. REFACTOR: share existing message timestamp/merge helpers where their contracts match; keep the public DTO independent from private state.

## Likely files

- `apps/web/lib/plugins/host-api.ts`
- new focused conversation client/hook modules under `apps/web/lib/plugins/`
- `apps/web/lib/plugins/types.ts`
- `apps/web/components/task/chat/messages/prompt-mention-components.tsx` only for a narrow wrapper if required
- `apps/web/lib/plugins/host.ts` lifecycle resource tracking and staged generation registration
- `apps/web/lib/plugins/registry.ts` isolated contribution/resource ledgers and atomic commit
- focused tests beside the implementation

## Verification

```bash
cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web test -- --run lib/plugins components/task/chat/messages/prompt-mention-components
cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck
```

Do not copy the core prompt-history component into Kandev or expose `host.store` fields.

## Current result

Recovery follow-up: [Task 02](../pr-3588-conversation-recovery/task-02-restore-core-snapshots.md)
and [Task 03](../pr-3588-conversation-recovery/task-03-recover-expired-continuations.md)
own the pending core and plugin recovery repairs. The results below remain
the original delivery record, not evidence for the new regressions.

Implemented the panel-scoped browser facade with subscription-before-snapshot
readiness, hydration, joined continuation paging, renewal, ordered
reconciliation, reconnect, poison fencing, atomic replacement-cursor rebind,
terminal removal, lifecycle abort, generation refresh, read-only favorites,
curated prompt mentions, and scoped desktop/mobile navigation. The production
core adapter validates the same versioned envelope and preserves
projection-before-ACK behavior. Concurrent panel isolation and registry
successor staging are covered by focused tests.

Verified:

- Focused browser Host, scope, registry, and task-panel suites
- `cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck`
- `cd apps/web && pnpm run lint`
