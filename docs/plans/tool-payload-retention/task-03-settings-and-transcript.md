# Task 03: Settings and Transcript

## Summary

Deliver the analysis, activation, and cleanup flow on desktop and phone. Show
removed tool details explicitly in conversations.

## In scope

- Add the independent card, API types/client/hook, discovery target, and route save
  contributor. Preserve unsaved drafts during status refresh and handle conflicts.
- Add optional analysis, stale/partial results, explicit backup choice, preparation,
  retry/cancel, enable/disable, Run cleanup now, and last/next status.
- Keep the Office card independent. Explain payload bytes versus compaction and
  backup storage. Show engine capability and read-only admin restrictions.
- Add removed-detail rendering for all supported tool kinds. Evict stale lazy
  output when committed markers arrive. Test cached output and reload behavior.
- Localize all copy in five languages. Generate Traditional Chinese using the
  repository workflow. Add desktop, phone, and member-gating browser coverage.

## Out of scope

Daily scheduler implementation, new compaction behavior, and database audits.

## ASCII UI preview

The [combined previews](plan.md#ascii-ui-preview) are authoritative. These excerpts
retain the same labels. Sample counts and spacing are illustrative.

UI-01, desktop disabled policy:

```text
Tool payload cleanup                                  [Off]
Tasks inactive for [3] [Months v]       [Analyze savings]
Estimated payload reduction: <size> | <messages> messages
Last cleanup: Never                    Next check: Disabled
```

UI-02, phone first-cleanup review:

```text
< System                  Data & Logs
Tool payload cleanup          [On*]
Tasks inactive for
[3                                 ]
[Months                           v]
[Analyze savings                   ]
Before the first cleanup
( ) Create backup (recommended)
( ) Continue without backup
[Discard]                     [Save]
```

UI-03, shared states: show scan progress/cancel, not analyzed/stale/empty,
backup preparing/failed/retry, and cleanup partial/failed/completed status.
UI-04, shared conversation row:

```text
<original tool title>             <original status>
Tool details removed on <date>.
<retained summary>
```

Structure is required. The phone uses the route scroll owner, stacked fields,
44px touch targets, and safe-area-aware shared Save bar. No layered dialogs.
Match all referenced acceptance criteria through rendered tests.

## Acceptance

1. Users can analyze without enabling, review backup choices, save, observe
   preparation/cleanup, and reload persistent state on desktop and phone.
2. Read-only users cannot mutate or trigger analysis. Pending, stale, error, and
   unsupported states are explicit. Office retention remains independent.
3. Every supported removed tool row retains its title/status and reports removed
   details. Cached output cannot reappear after marker delivery or reload.

## Tests and verification

Use `/tdd`, `/mobile-parity`, and `/e2e`. Bootstrap workspace dependencies once
if absent. Run commands independently from the repository root:

```bash
(cd apps && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec vitest run components/settings/system/tool-payload-retention-card.test.tsx hooks/domains/system/use-tool-payload-retention.test.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec vitest run components/task/chat/messages/tool-execute-message.test.tsx hooks/domains/session/use-shell-command-output.test.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run i18n:zh-hant)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run i18n:check)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run i18n:ratchet)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project chromium tests/system/tool-payload-retention.spec.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project mobile-chrome tests/system/mobile-tool-payload-retention.spec.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project auth tests/auth/system-data-storage-member-gating.spec.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project mobile-chrome tests/auth/mobile-system-data-storage-member-gating.spec.ts)
git diff --check
```

Add equivalent removed-state tests for other supported tool renderers in their
owning test files. Record additional targeted commands with the implementation.

## Files likely touched

- `apps/web/components/settings/system/data-logs-settings.tsx`,
  `tool-payload-retention-card.tsx`, and tests.
- `apps/web/hooks/domains/system/use-tool-payload-retention.ts` and tests.
- System API client/types, job state, settings discovery, and locale catalogs.
- Tool-message renderers, `shell-output-disclosure.tsx`,
  `hooks/domains/session/use-shell-command-output.ts`, and their existing tests.
- The desktop/mobile E2E files and existing auth member-gating specs.

## Dependencies and parallelism

Depends on Task 02. Frontend work uses the agreed backend contract. Share policy/job logic across desktop and phone.

## Inputs

Read the linked design, plan UI-01 through UI-04, settings save coordinator,
`RetentionSettingsCard`, and nearest mobile data-storage tests before editing.

## Risks

A switch draft is not effective enablement. Save success with pending backup
must not display cleanup as enabled. Partial results must not resemble success.

## Results

Implemented the independent Data & Logs card, shared Save/Discard contributor,
API client and hooks, analysis states, explicit backup choice, cleanup controls,
and removed-detail transcript rendering. Office retention remains independent.

- 90 focused component, hook, renderer, and message-store tests passed. After
  lint refinements, all 29 affected tests passed again.
- `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run i18n:check`, and
  `pnpm run i18n:ratchet`: passed. Full web lint reports zero warnings/errors.
- English, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, both generated Traditional Chinese
  catalogs, and pseudo-locale include the new states and skip reasons.
- Browser tests cover backup and explicit skip activation, actual removed
  metadata, original backup contents, protected recent activity, and persistence.
  Phone flows cover 320px and 390px, touch targets, and horizontal overflow.
- Member/admin browser tests exercise both system routes and server-side denial
  of retention analysis and mutations. Final browser totals are in the plan.

## Approved UX refinement (implemented)

This refinement supersedes the earlier layout previews. Messages compaction
uses the existing shared Save changes/Discard controls and explicit backup
consent; the automatic schedule is unchanged.

Desktop (bounded card width):

```text
Messages compaction
Remove old tool inputs and outputs; keep message metadata.
Tasks inactive for [3] [Months v] [Analyze savings]
Analysis outcome and timestamp
> Analysis details
------------------------------------------------------
[off] Automatic compaction
Checks every 24 hours while Kandev is running.
First run starts after backup preparation.
[Backup choice appears here when enabling]
Last run: <status and time>   > Run details
Next check: <time or Disabled>
[Compact messages now]
Space reuse and database file compaction explanation
```

Phone: number and unit remain adjacent; Analyze savings takes its own full-width
row. Controls and disclosure summaries have 44px touch targets. The existing
settings page owns scrolling and the shared Save bar. Partial results, stale
estimates, and errors remain visible outside collapsed details.

Validation: focused component/hook tests, desktop backup/skip flows, and phone
flows at 320px and 390px, including disclosure and control geometry checks.
