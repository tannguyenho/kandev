# Task 02: Repair confirmed popup positioning

## Summary

After the phone comparison confirms a geometry cause and the user explicitly
requests implementation, reconcile the owning system design and repair the
shared popup. If activation is the cause, revise this work order before coding.

## In scope

Browser-coordinate normalization, non-collapsing containment, viewport reflow,
and focused tests. Keep the existing above/below placement contract, portal,
one scrolling list, selection and focus semantics.

## Out of scope

Search changes, input/IME rewrites, new drawers, global overlays, unrelated
clipboard problems, automatic upgrades, or production diagnostic probes.

## Acceptance

1. A regression reproduces the confirmed measurements before the repair and
   passes afterward; an off-screen anchor cannot collapse an otherwise usable
   picker. Ordinary adjacency and below placement remain correct.
2. Both `@` and `#` remain visible/selectable before Done on the reporting
   device; automated tests prove internal scrolling, 44-pixel rows, retained
   focus, no implicit send, and viewport reflow without retyping.
3. The final implementation lives in the shared React primitive, not in a
   proxy, mutation observer, or independent DOM-styling layer.

## ASCII UI preview

UI-01 excerpt from the [full preview](plan.md#ascii-ui-preview):

```text
Suggestions (heading + scrolling rows)
Composer: @mobile  [focus stays here]
iOS keyboard      [remains open]
```

Desktop retains ordinary caret adjacency without the keyboard. Maps to all
five criteria above; the phone capture verifies the order and reachability.

## Verification

```bash
(cd apps/web && pnpm test -- components/task/chat/popup-menu.test.tsx)
(cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web build:e2e)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --host --project mobile-chrome \
  tests/chat/mobile-prompt-mention-composer.spec.ts \
  tests/chat/mobile-entity-reference-composer.spec.ts \
  tests/chat/mobile-slash-command-composer.spec.ts \
  tests/task/mobile-task-create-escape.spec.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --host --no-build --project chromium \
  tests/chat/entity-reference-composer.spec.ts \
  tests/chat/slash-command-composer.spec.ts \
  --grep 'task chat restores a keyboard-selected draft|selecting a slash command keeps it as an editable draft|keeps Kandev task suggestions under @')
(cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck)
(cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web lint)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run i18n:ratchet)
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
git diff --check
```

Define an exact targeted WebKit command in this work order when its configured
project exists; do not list a nonexistent project as runnable verification.
The user confirmed the Task 01 physical-device candidate, then requested
shutdown and production integration. Report that confirmation separately from
automated integrated-patch results; do not claim a second physical-device run.

## Files likely touched

- `apps/web/components/task/chat/popup-menu.tsx` and `popup-menu.test.tsx`.
- The existing mobile `@` and `#` E2E files, and Playwright configuration if a
  runnable focused WebKit lane is added.
- `apps/web/package.json` and `apps/pnpm-lock.yaml` only if declaring the
  existing positioning library as a direct dependency.
- The owning system design, this work order, and `plan.md`.

## Dependencies

Task 01 and a later explicit implementation request.

## Risks

Browser emulation cannot certify an actual iOS keyboard. Late positioning
callbacks must not update closed menus. Preserve short-result sizing and the
plan editor's below placement; do not apply the above-menu experiment blindly
to every shared consumer.

## Parallelism

sequential

## Inputs

Task 01 evidence, active overlay requirements, current system design, and
the earlier mobile-composer-suggestion-viewport package.

## Results

The shared popup now delegates client-to-fixed coordinate normalization to
Floating UI's real DOM platform. Size-before-shift preserves short and long
list adjacency where usable; an occluded above anchor can use the padded
viewport without collapsing. The heading and list share a constrained flex
column. React owns all subscriptions and disposal; both stale promises and
already-queued callbacks are ignored after cleanup. Search, suggestion plugins,
selection handlers, and draft serialization are unchanged.

Red evidence: the original helper returned zero height for the recorded
Safari-like client/viewport inputs, and the new offset-viewport mobile prompt
test failed its reachability assertion against the old build. Additional
focused red tests exposed missing-to-ready anchor initialization and a queued
callback after disposal; both are covered in the integrated unit suite.

The first integrated mobile run passed all geometry and touch-selection
assertions but one transcript assertion compared `innerText` with
`textContent`. It was corrected to check persisted message count through the
API, as the sibling external-reference test does. Final results follow below.

- Unit suite: 16 passed.
- Final fresh-build mobile E2E: 7 passed (38.5 seconds). The final run used
  `CAPTURE_PR_ASSETS=true` and `--no-build` after a successful `build:e2e` of
  the final production changes.
- Selected desktop E2E: 3 passed (27.7 seconds), covering `@`, `#`, and `/`
  keyboard selection, draft restoration, and explicit submission.
- Full lint and final changed-file lint, typecheck, i18n ratchet, specification
  lint, and whitespace check: passed.
- Inspected `apps/web/.pr-assets/mobile-prompt-mention-composer--mobile-composer-prompt-menu.png`:
  contained, caret-adjacent heading/list above the focused phone composer.
- Original phone candidate: user-confirmed. Integrated physical-device run:
  not repeated after the user's requested shutdown. WebKit host launch remains
  unavailable because GTK/GStreamer dependencies are missing; no host package
  installation was performed.
- Test instance stopped and temporary evaluation data/diagnostic ZIPs deleted.
  Final listener check shows only the unchanged main PID 3960526 on port 9998;
  evaluation ports 48761, 48762 and 50761 are closed.

Ready for Open PR. No commit, push, or PR was created during this phase.

## PR review follow-up

Rendering and middleware now share `POPUP_MENU_SIZE`; the geometry and visible
appearance remain unchanged. The signed-overflow invariant and E2E minimum
height are documented. A stable mention-surface test ID replaces wrapper
traversal, geometry tolerances are symmetric, missing-anchor assertions include
hidden DOM, and mocked task references use valid synthetic UUIDs instead of
creating unused backend rows. The phone comparison explicitly marks original
selection acceptance criterion 3 unverified and its instructions historical.

Two review-driven contract tests passed before the constant refactor: initially
narrow menus still recover the padded viewport width, and same-size results
refresh a stable virtual-caret callback. A disposable check of the proposed
`children`-dependency removal failed with menu bottom 232 instead of 192;
restoring the dependency passed. Keep that required update path.

Post-review local checks:

- `pnpm test -- components/task/chat/popup-menu.test.tsx`: 18 passed.
- Fresh-build mobile command above: 7 passed. After final test-selector and
  fixture refinements, reran the two changed mobile `@`/`#` specs with
  `pnpm e2e:run --host --no-build --project mobile-chrome` after `build:e2e`:
  4 passed.
- The selected desktop command above: 3 passed.
- Web typecheck, changed-file ESLint, specification lint, and whitespace check:
  passed. Normal commit hooks remain required.

No public contract or rendered-UI behavior changed, so the owning design and
published screenshots remain representative. Remote checks and review
dispositions remain pending until the refinement commit's CI completes.

## CI follow-up

The full frontend job exposed two existing entity-reference menu assertions
that queried accessible options synchronously, before asynchronous popup
positioning made them visible. Both failures reproduced on the CI-equivalent
merge tree. The assertions now await accessible options with `findByRole`;
they still require visible options and successful selection, without a
positioning mock, hidden-element query, or increased timeout.

- `CI=true pnpm exec vitest run components/task/chat/entity-reference-menu.test.tsx components/task/chat/popup-menu.test.tsx`:
  23 passed after the test-only correction.
- Changed-file ESLint, web typecheck, and whitespace check: passed.

This frontend correction changes no production behavior or public contract.

The container-shard failure exposed a separate SSH recovery defect. Replaying
the exact 23-test CI shard without retries reproduced its teardown timeout.
A disposable probe forced recovery after a second backend restart and captured
the same failure: authenticated health requests used the intermediate local
execution ID, while the remote controller still expected its original launch
ID. Readiness retries held a lifecycle read lock long enough to block task
deletion past its cleanup deadline.

SSH now persists the remote controller's launch identity independently of
replacement local execution IDs. Same-session recovery retains it; sibling
sessions and replacement controllers do not inherit it. Legacy rows keep the
existing previous-execution fallback and record that identity for subsequent
recovery. The existing browser test now verifies two successive reconnects.
The [SSH recovery design](../../specs/executors/system-design/ssh-executor.md#recovery-after-backend-restart)
records this internal contract. Public executor instructions remain unchanged:
this restores their documented live-controller reuse, with no new setting or
operator action.

- New Go regression failed on recovery 2 before the fix, for both client
  construction paths. Fresh-controller identity and metadata lifecycle tests
  also failed before the fix.
- `go test ./internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle -run 'Test(SSH|ResumedSSH|ShouldPersist|FilterPersistent)' -count=1`:
  passed after the fix.
- `go test ./internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle -count=1`: passed (53.481 seconds).
- `golangci-lint run ./internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/... --new-from-rev=origin/main --timeout=5m`:
  passed with zero issues.
- Web typecheck, changed-file ESLint, specification lint, and whitespace check:
  passed.

- The disposable forced-order SSH probe passed after the repair (27.9 seconds),
  then its fixture instrumentation and temporary ordering code were removed.
- `CI=true KANDEV_E2E_CONTAINERS=1 pnpm e2e:run --host --no-build --project containers tests/ssh/add-workspace-sources.spec.ts -- --retries=0 --trace=retain-on-failure`:
  the permanent two-restart test passed (26.9 seconds), using local Node 24.0.0
  and freshly rebuilt backend/helper/plugin artifacts on the CI-equivalent
  merge tree with the repair applied.

Remote CI/review status and the final current-base integration evidence are
tracked on [PR #3596](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/pull/3596).

## CodeRabbit recovery-assertion follow-up

A fresh SSH listener does not guarantee a different numeric port. The recovery
test now waits for `workspace.file.get` to read the attached remote fixture
through Kandev after each restart, retaining the direct remote-content and UI
file-tree assertions. A disposable probe that reported the original port after
recovery reproduced the old assertion's 60-second false failure. This changes
only test evidence, not the SSH runtime or its recovery contract.

The same probe passed with the new assertion (30.1 seconds). After removing the
probe, the permanent SSH E2E passed (30.9 seconds), with Node 24.20.0, one worker,
and no retries. Changed-file ESLint, typecheck, specification lint, and
whitespace checks also passed.
