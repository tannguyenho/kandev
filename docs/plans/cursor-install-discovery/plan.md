# Implementation plan: Cursor install discovery

## Overview

Repair the shared native launcher's backend PATH so agents installed in the
runtime user's `.local/bin` can be discovered and executed. One sequential work
order covers the environment producer, its consumers, regression tests, and docs.

## Evidence and diagnosis

- User reports macOS with regular `npx` and service launch. Terminal resolves
  both `agent` and `cursor-agent` under `/Users/ram58/.local/bin`.
- `agents/cursor_acp.go` checks only `cursor-agent` through process PATH.
  Its installer exports `.local/bin` in its child shell and appends to `.bashrc`;
  neither changes a running parent's environment.
- `launcher/service.go` omits `.local/bin` from `launchdServicePath`.
  `backendEnvForConfig` currently forwards PATH without supplementing it.
- Post-install cache invalidation and capability refresh already exist in
  `controller.SetJobBroadcaster`; rescanning alone cannot repair the environment.
- The regular-launch failure is reproducible when its inherited PATH omits the
  install directory. The user's historical regular-launch process PATH has not
  been captured; do not claim that specific process environment was verified.
- A Linux diagnostic bundle was collected before the macOS clarification and
  deleted. It is not evidence about the affected Mac.

## Scope

In scope: shared Unix child environment normalization, actual Cursor discovery
and subprocess execution, launchd-input coverage, late installation, precedence,
restart propagation, and CLI documentation.

Out of scope: alias expansion, authentication, installer replacement, remote
executor changes, frontend code, service-account changes, and live-instance
mutation. Both Cursor binary names already exist in the reported installation.

## Technical approach

Follow [the design](../../specs/platform/system-design/local-agent-path.md).
Add the effective user's `.local/bin` once to the end of the final child PATH
in `backendEnvForConfig`. Apply before subprocess creation and retain the path
even when the directory does not yet exist. Keep service definitions compatible;
fixing only the generated plist would miss regular and existing service launches.

## Tests and end-to-end evidence

Use `internal/launcher/local_agent_path_test.go` for the acceptance matrix.
`TestLocalAgentPathPostInstall` must create an isolated home, obtain the real
launcher-produced environment before installation, create fake `agent` and
`cursor-agent` executables afterward, and drive actual Cursor discovery and
subprocess execution under that environment. Expect failure before the patch.

`TestLocalAgentPathLaunchd` must parse PATH from `renderLaunchdPlist` and pass it
through the actual backend environment producer. Include a distinct Kandev data
home. Add cases for existing PATH precedence, duplicate normalization, empty
PATH, unavailable home, missing/non-executable files, and Windows preservation.
Cover backend child restart propagation using the existing supervisor test seam.
This is process-level end-to-end evidence; no browser layout changes are planned.

On an isolated macOS runtime, confirm installation followed by rescan exposes
Cursor and a local probe executes for regular and service launches. Record this
as pending if no macOS runner is available; Linux fixture execution is not a
native macOS smoke test.

## Work orders

- [x] [Task 01: Preserve local agent PATH](task-01-local-agent-path.md)

## Verification results

Temporary `TestReproCursorPostInstallPath` created both executable names under
an isolated home after obtaining `backendEnv` with `/usr/bin:/bin` PATH. Actual
`CursorACP.IsInstalled` returned unavailable. Command:
`GOCACHE=/tmp/kandev-cursor-go-cache go test ./internal/launcher -run '^TestReproCursorPostInstallPath$' -count=1`
failed with `installed Cursor is invisible under launcher-produced PATH`, as
expected. The temporary test was removed at the design checkpoint. This ran on
Linux and verifies the shared Go path; native macOS execution remains pending.

`python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate` passed (272 decisions, 936 specifications).
`python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all` passed.
Implemented in `env.go` and `local_agent_path.go`; regression coverage is in
`local_agent_path_test.go`. Public CLI documentation updated.

- `GOCACHE=/tmp/kandev-cursor-go-cache go test ./internal/launcher -run '^TestLocalAgentPath' -count=1`: passed after failing on missing discovery before the patch.
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/kandev-cursor-go-cache go test -race ./internal/launcher ./internal/agent/agents ./internal/agent/runtime/agentctl/launcher -count=1`: both agent packages passed; launcher required the isolated rerun below because the sandbox forbids sockets and inherited runtime settings conflict with fixture values.
- Launcher rerun outside the socket-restricted sandbox: Python copied `os.environ` excluding keys starting with `KANDEV_`, set `GOCACHE=/tmp/kandev-cursor-go-cache`, and ran `go test -race ./internal/launcher -count=1`. Passed (14.310s).
- `python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate`: passed.
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Final lint correction reused the existing `goosWindows` constant; the focused regression suite was rerun with `-race` afterward.
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` from `apps/`: passed for commit-hook dependencies.

Native macOS regular/service smoke testing was not available on this Linux
runner. The generated launchd environment, actual discovery, executable
precedence, late installation, absence behavior, and supervised restart are
covered by process-level tests. Windows preservation is included as a
platform-conditional test but was not executed on Windows here.


## Risks

The fix must use the runtime account home, preserve PATH precedence, cover late
installation, and propagate to subprocesses. An already-running old launcher or
agentctl may retain its old environment until the runtime is restarted. If the
regular-launch symptom persists with a verified correct PATH, investigate that
separately instead of expanding this repair without evidence.

## PR review remediation

Codex identified that a system LaunchDaemon can inherit an absent or incorrect
HOME after selecting a non-root account. System-service local executable PATH
now uses the effective UID's account home and preserves PATH when lookup fails.
Added `local_agent_service_path_test.go` with a generated non-root LaunchDaemon
fixture, actual discovery/execution, and failed/invalid account lookup coverage.
Regular launches retain final child HOME precedence.

Claude's delayed summary suggestion is addressed with a comment on
`launchdServicePath` explaining that runtime normalization supplies the user
executable directory because launchd has no home-directory specifier. This
clarification changes no executable behavior.

CodeRabbit's summary suggestion is addressed by documenting the usable absolute
home condition in the requirement and public CLI guide.

Remediation validation:
- `GOCACHE=/tmp/kandev-cursor-go-cache go test -race ./internal/launcher -run '^TestLocalAgentPath' -count=1`: passed.
- `go test -race ./internal/launcher -count=1` with inherited `KANDEV_*` settings removed, writable GOCACHE, and local socket access: passed (16.928s).
- `python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate`, `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`, and `git diff --check`: passed.

Remote CI/review evidence remains pending for the remediation head.


## CI test remediation

Backend shard 2 failed in `TestCompletedTaskFollowUpAdmissionIsConversationalOnly`
because the follow-up raced unfinished terminal-step session preparation.
The test now joins the existing `onProcessOnEnterComplete` signal before
admitting the follow-up. Its behavior assertions are unchanged; no production
contract or public documentation change is needed.

With inherited `KANDEV_*` settings removed and writable GOCACHE,
`go test -race ./internal/orchestrator -run '^TestCompletedTaskFollowUpAdmissionIsConversationalOnly$' -count=20`
reproduced the original assertion failure in root and child cases (189.376s),
then passed after synchronization (191.113s). Remote suite validation remains
pending for the new test-fix head.
