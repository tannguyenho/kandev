# Implementation Plan: Retry classified-transient legacy post-start failures

## Overview

Close "Hole 1" of the Beta unattended-recovery review: the legacy
(non-routing) post-start failure path, `HandleAgentFailure`, had no retry at
all — one transient blip counted as a full strike toward auto-pause. One
sequential work order adds a bounded, classified-transient retry to that path
before it can count toward `consecutive_failures`.

## Evidence and root cause

`handleAgentFailed` tries the routing tier (`tryPostStartFallback`) first and
falls through to `HandleAgentFailure` when there is no dispatcher or no
`ResolvedProviderID`. `HandleAgentFailure` (`office/service/failure.go`)
incremented `consecutive_failures` immediately on every failure, with no
classification step, so a single transient upstream blip on that fallthrough
path auto-paused the agent at the same rate as a genuine terminal failure.
The working routing-tier retry (`office/scheduler/routing_lifecycle.go`) and
pre-launch retry (`office/service/retry.go`) already handle their own paths
correctly and are unchanged.

## Scope

### In scope

- A bounded classified-transient retry on the legacy post-start path only,
  reusing the existing routing classifier's `ClassTransient && AutoRetryable
  && FallbackAllowed` predicate (no second classifier).
- A claim-guarded write so the retry can never resurrect a run the claim path
  has already cancelled for staleness.
- Regression coverage for the new eligibility gate, the scheduled-arrival
  staleness check, agent id / `providerError.ProviderID` substitution, and the
  `claimed -> failed -> queued` race this closes.

### Out of scope

- Hole 2 (automatic unpause) — blocked on card `497b1f63` (broken manual
  unpause); a product decision, not part of this change.
- Hole 3 (reaper for runs stranded in `claimed`) — already shipped on `main`
  as `recoverStaleClaimedRuns`.
- The pre-launch retry tier, the routing-tier retry policy, and the
  `blocked_provider_action_required` park — all unchanged by design.
- `apps/web` — no frontend surface for this change.

## Technical approach

Follow the [system design](../../specs/office/system-design/runtime-01.md#legacy-post-start-transient-retry).
Add `routingerr.(*Error).ShouldShortRetry()` (nil-safe) as the single shared
transient predicate; `officeShortRetryAllowed` in the scheduler delegates to
it so there is exactly one definition for both callers (`office/scheduler`
already imports `office/service`, so the shared predicate lives in
`routingerr`). `HandleAgentFailure` calls a new `tryLegacyTransientRetry`
first; `MarkRunFailed` only runs when that returns false.

`tryLegacyTransientRetry` eligibility: `RetryCount < 2`, the existing 24h
`retryMaxAge`, and a scheduled-arrival gate that refuses the retry (falling
through to terminal accounting) when `age + delay` already exceeds the 2h
`staleRunThreshold` the claim path uses to cancel stale runs — otherwise the
run could age into the cancellation window during its own backoff and the
failure would be silently lost instead of counted. The provider error's
`ProviderID` (or the caller's `AgentID`) is threaded into the classifier
before the predicate runs.

The write path is a new `ScheduleRetryIfClaimed` (`WHERE id=? AND
status='claimed'`, returns affected-row count) instead of the unguarded
`ScheduleRetry`. On success the run goes `claimed -> queued` directly and
never visits `failed`. Zero affected rows or a DB error falls through to the
existing `MarkRunFailed`, whose identical guard no-ops the same way — this is
what closes the `claimed -> failed -> queued` race a plain
claim-then-schedule ordering would leave open.

Backoff is 5s then 10s, capped at 2 retries, sharing the existing
`retry_count` column with the pre-launch tier (`MaxRetryCount = 4`), so the
combined budget can never be exceeded and no new column is needed.

## Tests

- `failure_transient_retry_test.go`: eligibility (retry-count cap, 24h
  staleness, scheduled-arrival gate), agent id / `providerError.ProviderID`
  substitution, and the classifier delegation (16 tests).
- `runs_queue_test.go`: `TestScheduleRetryIfClaimed*` covering the
  claimed-only guard and its zero-rows fallthrough (2 tests).
- `routingerr/short_retry_test.go`: table test for `ShouldShortRetry` across
  the classifier's boolean combinations, nil-safe (1 table, 5 cases).

## End-to-end evidence

No `apps/web` files change (`git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD` — 13
files, 0 under `apps/web/`), so no Playwright coverage is required. Backend
package tests exercise the real SQLite-backed run repository, not mocks.

## Verification results

Implementation completed 2026-09-16, PR
[#3725](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/pull/3725).

- `go build ./...`: clean. `gofmt -l` over changed `.go` files: empty.
- `make -C apps/backend lint`: "0 issues."
- `make typecheck`: exit 0. `make lint-format`: clean.
- `go test -tags fts5 -count=1 ./internal/office/... ./internal/runs/...
  ./internal/agent/runtime/routingerr/...`: every touched package passes.
- `python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate`: "Validated 278 decisions and 952
  specifications." `lint-spec-files.py --all`: all passed.
- `python3 scripts/lint-architecture.py --all`: clean.
- Full `make -C apps/backend test`: 15 pre-existing FAIL packages, none in a
  package this diff touches (standing KB clusters, unrelated to this change).

for the full command list and receipts.

## Risks

The retry re-drives the whole run from the top only after the lifecycle event
identifies the exact run and proves that no output or effect was observed for
the current invocation.
Unknown, stale, output-producing, effectful, or diagnostically mismatched
events fall through to terminal accounting.

## Documentation impact

`docs/specs/office/requirements/runtime.md` gained AC-OFFICE-RUNTIME-001.11;
`docs/specs/office/system-design/runtime-01.md` § Legacy post-start transient
retry was rewritten to match the implementation. No public-docs or operator-
facing surface changed.
