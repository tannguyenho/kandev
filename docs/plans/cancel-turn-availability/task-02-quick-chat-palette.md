# Task 02: Scope Quick Chat palette cancellation

## Summary

Expose a localized cancel-only command for the active Quick Chat conversation.
Ensure the command cannot target an underlying task or an inactive chat.

## In scope

- Add `quick-chat-cancel-commands.tsx`, mounted by `QuickChatContent`, with explicit
  session ID, eligibility, and the existing `handleCancelTurn` callback.
- Reuse `buildSessionCommands` and `useRegisterCommands`. Scope registration to
  open Quick Chat, conversation kind, and matching active session ID.
- Suppress the task `session-cancel` entry while Quick Chat is open. Restore it
  on close without suppressing unrelated task commands.
- Apply the composer eligibility rule and guard dispatch while backend or
  optimistic cancellation is pending. Preserve cleanup across tab switching.
- Prove exact callback/request identity and no duplicate cancellation entries.

## Out of scope

Registering task/git/panel actions inside Quick Chat; terminal cancellation or
new palette state architecture; changing the command registry globally.

## Acceptance

1. Add a registry integration test named `targets only the active Quick Chat
   session over a running task`. Exercise actual `SessionCommands` and Quick
   Chat source registration together under `CommandRegistryProvider`, assert one
   cancel entry, and inspect its action.
2. Cover A-to-B chat switching, closing Quick Chat, unmount, terminal/setup/idle
   content, disconnected clarification, and pending cancellation. No stale
   callback, duplicate entry, or underlying task cancel may remain active.
3. Desktop and phone E2E open the command panel through their existing entry,
   invoke cancellation, and verify the exact session settles while the underlying
   task keeps running. Preserve the phone's visible composer cancel fallback.

## ASCII UI preview

UI-02, desktop and phone command result
([full preview](plan.md#ascii-ui-preview), criterion .11):

```text
Search: cancel
Agent
  Cancel turn -> active Quick Chat session
```

Idle/setup/terminal foreground content shows no session-cancel result.
Use the existing responsive command-panel composition and touch controls.
UI-01's composer remains the direct phone action; no keyboard is required.

## Verification

Run from the repository root, after Task 01's dependency installation.

```bash
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec vitest run components/quick-chat/quick-chat-cancel-commands.test.tsx components/session-commands.test.tsx)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec eslint components/quick-chat/quick-chat-cancel-commands.tsx components/quick-chat/quick-chat-content.tsx components/session-commands.tsx e2e/tests/chat/quick-chat-cancel-palette.spec.ts e2e/tests/chat/mobile-quick-chat-cancel-palette.spec.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run i18n:check)

## Dependencies

Task 01: composer availability and eligibility wiring.

## Risks

Preserve clarification suppression, pending-state session identity, and direct
steering delivery. Palette sources do not deduplicate matching command IDs.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- [Requirements](../../specs/ui/requirements/cancel-turn-progress.md).
- [Design](../../specs/ui/system-design/cancel-turn-availability.md).
- [Plan and source-trace evidence](plan.md).

## Results

- The earlier review correctly identified that the claimed RED integration
  result was unsupported: the original test only exercised the command builder.
  The regression is now an actual registry test with both command producers
  mounted.
- GREEN: Quick Chat registers one cancel command only for its active structured
  conversation, uses that conversation's session ID and existing cancel
  handler, and guards duplicate dispatch while cancellation is pending. Task
  cancellation is suppressed for the full Quick Chat open state and restored
  when it closes. The registry matrix covers A-to-B switching, unmount cleanup,
  setup/terminal/idle and disconnected clarification states, backend-pending
  rejection, and retry after a failed request.
- The command row uses the existing coarse-pointer sizing convention so the
  mobile palette action remains touch-sized. Focused registry tests, typecheck,
  i18n, targeted ESLint, Vite build, and desktop/mobile E2E coverage passed.
  The mobile palette measured at least 44px and had no horizontal overflow.
- Desktop and phone Quick Chat composer regressions negotiate steering, observe
  generating activity with an empty editor and queue, use the visible cancel
  control, and wait for the exact session to settle. Desktop also covers
  detached background work.
- Failed Quick Chat cancellation callbacks are logged and clear the optimistic
  guard so a later command can retry the same session.
- Final review cleanup adds an assertion that the underlying task cancel control
  remains enabled after Quick Chat closes. The desktop Quick Chat suite passes
  all 3 tests with this assertion.
