# Task 01: Preserve asynchronous workflow launch input

## Summary

Carry immutable workflow input across launch admission and persist it when that asynchronous launch fails before delivery.
Keep existing recovery actions, queue policy, failure projection, and executor cleanup authoritative.

## In scope

- Add the private attempt envelope and retire it on success or synchronous rejection.
- Bind task, session, execution evidence, turn, workflow entry, and final dynamic attempt ownership.
- Persist raw queue-form input once through the accepted failure path, without immediate auto-resume scheduling.
- Retry queue admission once while the same attempt owns the preservation
  claim; keep the launch error visible after a failed retry.
- Retain recorded-message identity, attachment ownership, references, handoff, origin, and plan mode.
- Add all tests named in the plan, including failure-to-recovery service coverage.

## Out of scope

New UI, public APIs, migrations, provider retries, and the existing post-start transient error mechanism.

## Acceptance

1. An asynchronous failure after successful launch return preserves the exact input and recovery delivers it once with one transcript row.
2. Stale, duplicate, terminal, archived, deleted, and superseded-entry callbacks cannot enqueue input or affect successor work.
3. Error projection, paused queues, synchronous failures, dynamic fallback, and success retain their established behavior.
4. A transient queue insertion error retries without losing prompt metadata or
   scheduling an automatic resume; a second failure keeps the original launch
   error visible.

## Regression procedure

1. Seed a `CREATED` session with a prepared execution and a step with reset plus automatic start.
2. Block the fake `StartAgentProcess` call with channels.
3. Drive workflow entry through the real service and prove the launch call returned without error.
4. Release the provider with a typed pre-delivery startup failure.
5. Await failure handling through explicit synchronization, then assert one preserved queue entry.
6. Before implementation, observe the expected red result: zero preserved
   entries.
7. Implement the ownership transfer, then recover through `RecoverTaskLaunch` and the normal boot-ready path.
8. Assert one provider prompt, one user message, and removal of the consumed queue entry.

Add table cases for generic, authentication, and managed-runtime bootstrap errors.
Exercise duplicate callback delivery and a failure before launch return.
Race replacement execution, same-execution successor turn, cancellation, completion, archive, deletion, and a later workflow entry.
Exercise a dynamic fallback candidate followed by success and a final failed candidate.
Cover combined handoff, attachment-only input, entity references, plan mode, and failed original message persistence.
Cover queue-full/write errors, one transient insertion retry, a paused queue,
and reopening the queue repository after preservation.
Verify no replay from successful startup or post-start prompt failure.

## Verification

Run these commands from the repository root after the TDD cycle:

```bash
(cd apps/backend && go test -tags fts5 ./internal/orchestrator -race -run 'TestWorkflowAsyncStartFailure|TestAutoStartCreatedLaunch|TestAutoStartTransientError_BootReadyDrainsOrphanedQueue|TestProcessOnEnterResetAgentContext' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go test -tags fts5 ./internal/orchestrator/executor -race -run 'TestStartAgentProcessAsync|TestBootstrapFailure|TestBuildBootstrapLastAgentError' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go test -tags fts5 ./internal/orchestrator/messagequeue -race -count=1)
python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
git diff --check
```

## Files likely touched

- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/workflow_start_prompt.go` (new)
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/workflow_start_prompt_test.go` (new)
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/event_handlers_workflow.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/task_operations.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/event_handlers_agent.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/executor/executor_execute.go` (only if callback propagation requires correction)
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/executor/workflow_start_prompt_test.go` (new, if executor behavior changes)

## Dependencies

None. Existing synchronous preservation and typed bootstrap errors are present in the investigated checkout.

## Risks

The accepted failure path must preserve input before recoverable failure routing can expose a promptable session.
Guard acquisition must not deadlock the launch caller, callback, or queue drain.
Do not infer current ownership from mutable session-only caches.
Do not replace existing dynamic-route or capacity callbacks with the prompt-preservation callback.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- [Requirement 005](../../specs/tasks/requirements/workflow-step-agent-start-ownership.md)
- [Asynchronous preservation design](../../specs/tasks/system-design/workflow-step-agent-start-ownership.md#asynchronous-launch-prompt-preservation)
- [Launch-error design](../../specs/tasks/system-design/task-launch-failure-recovery.md)
- Existing patterns: `event_handlers_duplicate_autostart_test.go`, `executor/executor_launch_failure_classification_test.go`, and `task_launch_recovery_test.go`.
- Existing queue rules: [server-owned auto-run](../../decisions/2026-08-16-server-owned-queue-auto-run.md).

## Results

Implemented the private immutable workflow-start attempt envelope and bound it
through initial-turn creation, prepared launch, dynamic process-start success,
and accepted asynchronous startup failure callbacks. Preserved input uses the
existing queue metadata and storage path, claims once, leaves auto-run policy
unchanged, and does not schedule a replacement from the failure callback.

Added service regressions for recovery delivery, effective plan-only and
config-only input, true-empty exclusion, duplicate and stale callback fencing,
metadata and failed-transcript preservation, classified bootstrap errors,
queue write and capacity failures, dynamic route ownership, paused queue
restart persistence, successful startup, and synchronous permanent rejection.
The stale-callback suite also commits a task move between the pre-admission
ownership read and queue insertion, and leaves and returns to the same step;
both cases assert that no obsolete queue row or dispatch is produced. The
production queue path captures the launch-time transition, session
incarnation, and lifecycle generation and validates them inside the shared
task/queue transaction. In-memory repositories fail closed for this strict
admission instead of claiming an atomic fence they cannot provide.

The effective-input regressions preserve empty raw queue content with mode
metadata, deliver one provider prompt, and assert one matching transcript
row/system block after recovery. A launch with no raw content, attachments,
references, handoff, plan mode, or session configuration remains excluded.
Admission capture failures now abort a prepared launch before the provider is
started, while legacy tasks without a transition row receive a durable current
entry before capture. Queue drains retain reserved entries when session
metadata reads fail, and recovery uses launch-time effective-input and
config-mode metadata rather than reclassifying a mode-only prompt from the
mutable session projection.

Queue persistence now retries once while the attempt claim remains owned. The
retry keeps the original launch error as the recovery signal and does not start
an automatic replacement.
