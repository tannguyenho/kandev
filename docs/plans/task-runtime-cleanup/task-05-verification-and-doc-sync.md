# Task 05: Verification and Doc Sync

## Acceptance

- Backend formatting, tests, lint, and build/type checks pass for touched areas.
- The spec and ADR still match the implemented behavior.
- Relevant `AGENTS.md` scoped guidance is updated if cleanup conventions changed.

## Verification

```bash
make -C apps/backend fmt
make -C apps/backend test
make -C apps/backend lint
make -C apps/backend build
```

## Files likely touched
