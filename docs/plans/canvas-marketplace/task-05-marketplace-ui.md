# Task 05: Build canvas marketplace browsing

## Summary

Add the Canvases tab, visual details, and upload/link/catalog installation to
Plugins settings. Use one review model across desktop and focused phone views.

## In scope

- Workspace selection, catalog cards with required registry cover, search/sort, instance
  actions, and Browse shared canvases from workspace settings.
- Shared canvas gallery with explicit controls, descriptions, one-image mode, image errors,
  enlargement within details, and keyboard/focus handling.
- Upload and direct-link forms, authoritative package/permission review,
  confirmation, progress/errors, retry, and installed Open canvas action.
- Typed API client and domain hooks with stale-response invalidation.
- Workspace-owner actions independent of native-plugin administrator gating.
- Localized labels/statuses across the canvas catalog; desktop/mobile E2E.

## Out of scope

Share/export author forms, canvas updates, and provider UI. Native plugin preview
extension is covered by Task 08.

## Acceptance

- UI-01/UI-02 support all three input paths through real inspection and explicit
  workspace permission approval, then show the installed canvas after reload.
- Gallery, failure states, per-workspace copies, and late-response handling work
  without executing the canvas in details or leaking another workspace's data.
- Phone composition, keyboard flow, actual touch targets, source outage,
  localization, and feature-off behavior pass the assigned rendered checks.

```

Upload/link opens final review without a gallery or screenshot requirement.
Registry canvas listings require preview URLs; broken remote preview shows Retry
without blocking installation. Inspecting is
announced; stale/expired review requires review again; incompatibility disables
confirm with its reason; success shows Open. Empty/degraded catalogs retain
Install canvas. Phone catalog uses one-column cards. Copy/layout details are
illustrative, action hierarchy and containment are required.

## Verification

Install dependencies once from `apps/` if not already installed. E2E fixtures
must not skip on missing canvas readiness. Record screenshots/geometry results
from the managed test artifacts and compare with UI-01/UI-02.

```bash
(cd apps/web && rtk pnpm exec vitest run lib/api/domains/canvas-distribution-api.test.ts lib/api/domains/marketplace-api.test.ts hooks/domains/canvas/use-canvas-install.test.ts hooks/domains/plugins/use-marketplace.test.ts components/settings/plugins/canvas-marketplace.test.tsx components/settings/plugins/canvas-marketplace-detail.test.tsx components/settings/plugins/marketplace-preview-gallery.test.tsx components/settings/plugins/plugin-row.test.tsx components/settings/plugins/install-plugin-dialog.test.tsx)

Create `install-plugin-dialog.test.tsx` only for the native compatibility cases
affected by shared entry controls; do not manufacture unrelated tests.

## Dependencies

Tasks 01-04 provide real package/catalog/installation routes. Reuse existing
canvas permission projections and the current native-plugin install dialog.

## Risks

Current plugin management controls are admin-gated; static workspace installs
must not inherit that restriction or weaken native controls. Late package and
workspace responses must not overwrite the review the user is confirming.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- Design: UI composition, Mobile contract, Catalog projection, Authorization.
- Existing `PluginsSettings`, `InstallPluginDialog`, `MarketplaceBrowser`.
- Existing canvas lifecycle review, `canvas-host-route.tsx`, `useResponsiveBreakpoint`.
- Canvas registry preview contract and current canvas installation controls.
- `apps/web/AGENTS.md`, /mobile-parity, /e2e, and existing canvas fixture tests.

## Results

Implemented the Canvases marketplace tab, workspace selection, search/category/
sort controls, registry cover cards, canvas preview gallery, detail/review
surfaces, upload/direct-link/catalog installation entry points, and localized
desktop/phone layouts with touch-sized controls. The optional native-plugin
preview extension is recorded in Task 08.

Verification: 8 focused Vitest files passed 21 tests; web typecheck, full lint,
i18n checks, and the new-code ratchet passed; desktop and mobile marketplace E2E
passed.

Review remediation: every responsive install-dialog dismissal now cancels the
staged review, including drawer and dialog outside-click or Escape handling.
