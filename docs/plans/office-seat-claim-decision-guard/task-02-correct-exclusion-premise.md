# Task 02: Correct The Stale Exclusion Premise

## Summary

Two pieces of prose assert that role-carrying decision recording and
registration lock on non-contending exclusions, or that the claim's condition
is therefore unreachable. Both stopped being accurate when the shared seat
exclusion landed. Re-document them to state what is true, without changing any
assertion, iteration count, or pool size.

## In scope

- Rewriting `TestPostgresAddTaskParticipant_ClaimDoesNotOverwriteAConcurrentDecision`'s
  docstring to claim only what its assertions support: that the two writers
  serialize on the shared seat exclusion, complete without deadlock in either
  acquisition order, and leave no reattributed decision.
- Correcting the comment at `participants.go:169-173` so it states that the
  exclusion closes the window for a role-carrying decision while the `UPDATE`'s
  condition remains the defense for a roleless one, and names the test from
  Task 01 as the coverage.
- A scan of the office and workflow suites for any other test documentation
  repeating the non-contending-namespaces premise.

## Out of scope

- Deleting, skipping, or weakening the existing concurrency test, reducing its
  iterations, or shrinking its connection pool.
- Any change to production behavior, SQL, or lock acquisition.
- Any acceptance criterion added to or amended in the
  participant-seat-provenance contract.
- Renaming the existing test.

## Acceptance

- No test documentation in the office or workflow suites asserts that
  role-carrying decision recording and registration lock on non-contending
  namespaces.
- The existing concurrency test's assertions, iteration count, and pool size
  are byte-identical to before this work order.
- The corrected production comment distinguishes the role-carrying case from
  the roleless one and states the invariant rather than the history of the bug.

## Verification

```bash
# From the repository root:
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/office/repository/sqlite/... -race -count=1
make -C apps/backend lint
git diff --cached --name-only | grep '\.go$' | xargs -r gofmt -l
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
git diff --check
```

## Files likely touched

- `apps/backend/internal/office/repository/sqlite/participant_claim_postgres_test.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/office/repository/sqlite/participants.go`

## Dependencies

- Task 01 adds the test that the corrected comment names as covering the
  roleless window.

## Risks

- A comment that argues the code is correct instead of stating the invariant
  reintroduces the failure this work order is fixing, in a new form. State
  which defense covers which window and stop.
- Rewriting the docstring is easy to combine with "tidying" the assertions.
  Confirm with a diff that only comment lines changed in the test file.
- Other suites may carry the same premise in passing. The scan is part of the
  work order because `AC-OFFICE-SEAT-GUARD-002.5` is written over the whole
  suite, not over one file.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- `docs/specs/office/requirements/seat-claim-decision-guard.md`,
  REQ-OFFICE-SEAT-GUARD-002.
- `docs/specs/office/system-design/seat-claim-decision-guard-01.md`, section
  "Verification obligations", items 2 and 3.
- `apps/backend/internal/office/repository/sqlite/participant_claim_postgres_test.go:78-93`.
- `apps/backend/internal/office/repository/sqlite/participants.go:166-173`.
- `CLAUDE.md`, "Code Quality", on comments stating the invariant rather than
  the argument for it.

## Results

- Rewrote `TestPostgresAddTaskParticipant_ClaimDoesNotOverwriteAConcurrentDecision`'s
  docstring to claim only what its assertions support: that the two writers
  serialize on the shared seat exclusion, complete in either acquisition order
  without deadlock, and leave no reattributed decision. It now says explicitly
  that it does not, and cannot, show the NOT EXISTS condition to be
  load-bearing, and points at the test that does.
- Confirmed by diff that the change is comment-only: no assertion, iteration
  count, or pool size was touched.
- Corrected the claim fallthrough comment in `participants.go`, which described
  the condition as a defensive backstop that "cannot actually interleave here".
  It now states which defense covers which decision.
- Also corrected `ParticipantRoleSeatLockKey`'s doc comment in
  `phase2_sqlite.go`, which presented the shared exclusion as fully closing the
  window. It is acquired only when the decision carries a role, and that
  omission is the same false completeness this work order exists to remove.
  This was a third site, beyond the two the work order named; the suite-wide
  scan `AC-OFFICE-SEAT-GUARD-002.5` requires is what surfaced it.
- The scan for the stale premise (`never contend with each other`,
  `two different advisory-lock namespaces`, `cannot actually interleave`) now
  returns nothing across `internal/`.
- `internal/office/repository/sqlite` and `internal/workflow/repository` pass
  with `-race`; `golangci-lint` reports 0 issues across `internal/office/...`
  and `internal/workflow/...`; specification lint passes.
