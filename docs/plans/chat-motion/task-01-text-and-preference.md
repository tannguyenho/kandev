# Text motion and appearance preference

## Summary and scope

Deliver live text/row motion and the persisted Appearance control end to end.
Read the paired requirements/design and root/web AGENTS.md before TDD.
Exclude scrolling mechanics (work order 02), backend settings, and non-chat
Markdown behavior. The final scrolling promise is completed by dependent 02.

## Likely files

- Proposed `apps/web/lib/settings/chat-motion.ts`, its test, and
  `lib/state/slices/ui/chat-motion-actions.ts` with tests; existing settings
  constants, `ui-slice.ts`, UI types, and `app-state-types.ts` for wiring.
- Proposed `apps/web/hooks/use-chat-motion.ts` and `.test.tsx`; existing
  `components/settings/appearance-settings-state.ts`, its test,
  `general-settings.tsx`, its test, and settings-discovery preferences catalog.
- Existing `components/task/chat/message-list-native.tsx`,
  `message-list-shared.tsx`, and message components; proposed chat arrival helper
  and `chat-motion.test.tsx`. Existing `components/shared/memoized-markdown.tsx`
  and tests; proposed `lib/markdown/chat-text-motion.ts` and `.test.ts`.
- `apps/web/app/globals.css`, supported `src/locales/*/settings.json`, and
  proposed `e2e/tests/chat/chat-motion.spec.ts` and `mobile-chat-motion.spec.ts`.

All abbreviated paths above are relative to apps/web. Keep new helpers narrow,
use existing Markdown dependencies, and do not enlarge already oversized files
with inline algorithms. Run the Traditional Chinese converter, not hand edits.

## Implementation acceptance

1. Default/storage, Appearance preview/save/cancel/rebase, OS precedence, and
   localized/discoverable switch pass unit and desktop/phone tests.
2. New inline suffixes and newly delivered rows animate once; old text, grouped
   updates, historical/refetched/remounted content, and rewritten Markdown do
   not replay. Unicode, copy, links, and comment selection remain correct.
3. Finite effects cancel on disable/hide/unmount; bursts do not create unbounded
   spans or effect queues. Record desktop/phone visual evidence and a stream trace.

## ASCII UI preview

### UI-01: Appearance, enabled and disabled (desktop and phone)

Entry: Settings > Preferences > Appearance. Existing navigation is retained.

```text
Appearance
  Rich output animations                [on]
  Chat animations                       [on]
  Animate incoming text, new chat items,
  and scrolling on this device.
  Respects reduced motion.
                              [Reset] [Save]

Saved off: Chat animations               [off]
OS reduced motion: saved switch stays on;
                   effective motion is off.
```

Both viewports retain this control order. Phone help text wraps below the
label; the switch has a 44 px hit area. Existing settings page owns scrolling
and Save/Reset placement. Spacing/copy are illustrative; control semantics,
localization, hierarchy, and touch reachability are required.

### UI-02: Live chat (shared content order, existing phone full-height layout)

```text
[Session header / navigation]                 fixed
[Existing transcript text]                    scrolls
[Assistant: existing text + incoming suffix]   suffix fades
[New tool row]                                enters once
[Composer and existing navigation controls]    outside scroller
```

Phone shows one full-height Chat surface; desktop retains its Dockview panel.
Only transcript content scrolls; composer and safe-area geometry are unchanged.
History/loading restoration and motion-off states use the same layout with
immediate content. No new empty/error state is introduced. UI-01 maps to
AC-UI-CHAT-MOTION-002.1 through .4; UI-02 maps to the 001 and 003 criteria.
The work-order E2E suites prove the rendered controls and motion states.

## Targeted verification

From repository root; initial install is needed only if dependencies are absent:

```bash
(cd apps && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec vitest run lib/settings/chat-motion.test.ts lib/state/slices/ui/chat-motion-actions.test.ts hooks/use-chat-motion.test.tsx lib/markdown/chat-text-motion.test.ts components/task/chat/chat-motion.test.tsx components/shared/memoized-markdown.test.tsx components/shared/chat-markdown-motion.test.tsx components/settings/appearance-settings-state.test.ts components/settings/general-settings.test.tsx lib/settings-discovery/catalog.test.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run i18n:check)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project chromium tests/chat/chat-motion.spec.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project mobile-chrome tests/chat/mobile-chat-motion.spec.ts)
git diff --check
```

Add behavioral RED tests before production code. E2E covers live append versus
history/remount, grouped new tools, preference reload/cancel, runtime reduced
motion, real finite opacity, text selection, and mobile control hit testing.
Use causal stream waits and finite animation completion, never fixed sleeps.
Run affected existing comment-selection tests if changing the selection boundary.

## Dependencies and risks

No work-order dependency. Depends on existing Appearance transaction and native
message list. Risk: source-offset mismatch after Markdown normalization; use
static fallback and explicit rewrite cases. Settings save must preserve new
edits made while saving. Structural previews above match the combined plan.

## Results

Implemented the per-device default-on preference, Appearance preview/Save/Reset,
localized discovery/copy, live reduced-motion policy, prose suffix fades,
new-row entrances, and selection-safe finite text runs.

Validation completed on 2026-09-15:

- The combined targeted run passed 198 tests across 18 files.
- Final lint cleanup and selection/comment regression rerun passed 94 tests
  across 5 files; changed TypeScript files lint cleanly.
- TypeScript, i18n checks (all five supported languages plus pseudo), public
  documentation validation (46 pages), and specification validation passed.
- Desktop and phone settings/live-motion scenarios passed on final assets.
  Phone suite: all 9 tests passed. Screenshots of both layouts were inspected.
- Browser tests measure real intermediate opacity, bounded scroll settling,
  wheel/touch interruption, and disabled/reduced-motion behavior. History readiness
  and finite entrance completion are causal waits; no fixed sleeps were added.
- No commit or push performed.

## Consolidated review remediation

Unmarked Markdown spans retain the caller's renderer; only marked spans enter
the reveal wrapper. The motion test fixture restores the original Web Animations
API descriptor after each test. The Traditional Chinese description uses
「項目」 for chat items, with a conversion override preserving that wording.

Validation: the custom-renderer regression failed before the fix. The combined
Markdown/scroll/search unit run passed 29 tests.

Validation commands from `apps/web`: `pnpm exec vitest run components/task/chat/chat-scroll-motion.test.ts hooks/domains/session/use-session-search.test.ts components/shared/chat-markdown-motion.test.tsx` (29 passed); `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run i18n:check`, and changed-file ESLint passed.
