# Task 01: Restore retained workspace access

## Summary

Allow workspace infrastructure for retained environments independently of agent
session completion. Preserve explicit Resume, permissions, cleanup ownership,
and provider conversation data.

## In scope

- Add the workspace admission check at all creation/registration boundaries
  and keep agent launch/promotion guards unchanged. Validate cache reuse too.
- Apply it to all three workspace ensure entry points. Retain common
  singleflight and cleanup-aware registration; re-read current ownership and
  roll back only the losing attempt's resources.
- Preserve attach-only retained inventory validation, including mixed valid
  and missing required repositories. Do not broaden branch recreation.
- Audit workspace persistence and agentctl events for session/task mutation,
  empty provider token writes, stale callbacks, and subsequent explicit Resume.
- Reconcile handler terminal-state failure mapping with actual workspace
  eligibility. Keep bounded, sanitized errors and operation-accurate logs.

## Out of scope

Frontend composition, new schemas, automatic agent recovery, archive policy,
or provider protocol changes.

## Acceptance

- All workspace entry points restore eligible terminal sessions without agent
  startup; missing/foreign/archived/cleanup-owned resources fail without mutation.
- Concurrent restore, cleanup, and Resume preserve one winning execution and
  current ownership. Existing live siblings and their agent processes survive.
- Restoring and persisting workspace access preserves provider conversation
  identity for later explicit Resume, including after backend restart.

## TDD entry

Use `TestEnsureExecutionAllowsTerminalWorkspaceWithoutStartingAgent` with real
retained inventory and the existing manager/runtime fakes. Assert workspace
success first; the baseline returns `ErrSessionTerminal`. Retain agent-launch,
promotion, and passthrough rejection tests. The focused lifecycle block
preserves the existing coalescing, cleanup, and workspace-validation coverage,
while the managed E2E crosses the real lifecycle manager and verifies the later
explicit Resume.

## Verification

Run the complete block from the repository root. These commands deliberately
cover both new workspace tests and the existing explicit-resume regressions.

```bash
(cd apps/backend && rtk go test -race ./internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle -run 'Test.*(WorkspaceRestore|EnsureExecution|EnsureWorkspaceExecution|GetOrEnsureExecution|CreateExecution|Coalesced|LaunchSession|TerminalSession|PersistExecutor)' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && rtk go test -race ./internal/orchestrator -run 'Test.*(CompletedWorkspace|CompletedSession|LaunchRestoreWorkspace|RecoverSession|Startup|Reclaim)' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && rtk go test -race ./internal/orchestrator/executor -run 'Test.*(Resume|TerminalSessionState)' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && rtk go test -race ./internal/orchestrator/handlers -run 'Test.*(Launch|Recover|Workspace)' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && rtk go test -race ./internal/agent/handlers -run 'Test.*(Workspace|Git|File|Shell|Terminal)' -count=1)
rtk git diff --check
```

## Files likely touched

- `apps/backend/internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/manager_execution.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/manager_launch.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/persistence.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/types.go` only if admission
  identity must carry additional existing ownership metadata.
- Corresponding `manager_execution_test.go`, `manager_launch_test.go`, and `persistence_test.go`.
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/session_launch.go` and `session_launch_test.go`.
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/completed_workspace_restore_test.go` (new).
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/handlers/handlers.go` and its tests.
- `apps/backend/internal/agent/handlers/git_handlers.go` and `git_handlers_test.go`.
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/executor/executor_resume.go` only for
  restoration/Resume coordination if the existing path needs adaptation.

## Dependencies

None. Baseline includes merged PR #3564. Read scoped backend guidance before
implementation; do not replace that PR's explicit completed-resume permission.

## Risks

Authorization must precede cache hits. Cleanup admission must remain durable.
Registration and rollback must retain current execution identity. Do not hold
lifecycle locks while waiting for callbacks that acquire the same locks.
If a schema change becomes necessary, revise the design and add the required
SQLite/PostgreSQL conformance checks before proceeding.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- [Requirements](../../specs/tasks/requirements/task-completion.md), IDs above.
- [Design](../../specs/tasks/system-design/task-completion.md), Workspace sections.
- [Existing explicit-resume work](../task-completion/task-04-session-resume.md).
- Existing lifecycle execution, persistence, and cleanup race tests; `/tdd`.

## Results

Implemented workspace-specific admission for retained terminal sessions. The
workspace path now validates current session, task-environment, ownership,
archive, cleanup, and provider identity before cache reuse or resource
creation. Agent start, promotion, and passthrough reconnect retain the strict
terminal-session guard.

Verification passed:

- Lifecycle block: 91 tests passed with `-race`.
- Orchestrator block: 125 tests passed with `-race`.
- Orchestrator/executor block: 105 tests passed with `-race`.
- Orchestrator/handlers block: 3 tests passed with `-race`.
- Agent/handlers block: 200 tests passed with `-race`.
- `rtk git diff --check` passed.

The managed desktop and mobile cold-runtime checks in Task 03 also exercise
the real retained-workspace path and subsequent explicit Resume.
