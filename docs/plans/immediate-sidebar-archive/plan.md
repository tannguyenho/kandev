# Implementation plan: Immediate sidebar archive

## Overview

Project accepted archive targets through the existing shared sidebar while the
request is pending. Tasks owns this extension because pending archive intent
and recovery are task lifecycle state. One sequential work order delivers the
complete change.

## Scope

Include selected/unselected archive, bulk and known cascade targets, failure,
refresh races, and desktop/phone parity. Exclude delete semantics, cleanup/API
changes, new navigation surfaces, and navigation redesign.

## Technical approach

The existing coordinator publishes pending state immediately but retains caches
via `switchOnly`; the sidebar reads those caches without observing pending state.
Extend `useWorkspaceSidebarTasks` with archive-only pending IDs backed by
`taskRemoval`, before downstream tree/group projections. Pass the marker through
the shared task row, dim it, and show a spinner while preserving canonical rows
for recovery and authoritative archived-inclusive saved-view behavior. See the
linked design's Immediate sidebar archive projection section.

## ASCII UI preview

UI-01: Active task navigation, archive A accepted (AC-003.1 through AC-003.3).

```text
Desktop sidebar              Phone task picker (reopened)
Before      Pending/Success  Before      Pending/Success
[A ...]     [A ...] (dim/spin) [A ...]     [A ...] (dim/spin)
[B ...]     [B ...]          [B ...]     [B ...]

Failure, A still active: [A ...] [B ...]
Last row archived: existing empty task list
```

The pending row keeps its place; success removes it and collapses the gap.
Spacing is illustrative.
Phone keeps its existing sheet, fixed header, safe-area padding, and single
scrolling list. Its visible menu is the archive entry point; acceptance retains
existing dismissal. No new mobile surface is needed for this frequent navigation
action. Existing `session-task-switcher-sheet.tsx` is the shipped exemplar.

## Tests

Add `use-workspace-sidebar-tasks.archive.test.ts` with a real removal-state transition
and deferred mutation: assert the pending marker before settlement, retention
across cache refresh, restoration after rejection, success removal after release,
unselected archive, non-cascade surviving children, cascade/bulk membership, and
archived views. Add a task-row test for dimming and the spinner. Use
`use-task-removal-coordinator.test.ts` to cover operation release and mixed bulk
success/failure where needed. These map to AC-003.1 through AC-003.3.

## E2E tests

Add `task/sidebar-immediate-archive.spec.ts` (chromium) and
`task/mobile-sidebar-immediate-archive.spec.ts` (mobile-chrome). Hold the archive
request before server processing, accept archive, and assert a dimmed spinner
row before release; withholding only the response is insufficient because WS may
win. Reopen the phone picker during the hold. Include cancellation, rejection
and successful completion cases. The real-store last-row test proves the final
empty projection; existing archive redirect specs cover the empty destination.
Use isolated fixtures and explicit deferred request release, never fixed sleeps.
All three new acceptance criteria need coverage.

## Work orders

- [x] [Task 01: Present pending archive rows](task-01-hide-pending-archive-rows.md)

## Verification results

Design validation passed on 2026-09-15: catalog validation (272 decisions,
934 specifications), full specification lint, specification-linter tests
(36 passed), and `git diff --check`. Implementation complete: the sidebar
projection, shared desktop/phone rows, and deferred regressions cover the
pending dimmed-spinner state, success removal, and failure recovery. Targeted
unit tests, typecheck, ESLint, formatting, and both desktop/phone browser tests
passed. Production backend and web builds passed. Both pending-state screenshots
were inspected against UI-01. The browser runs required local socket permission
outside the sandbox and reused fresh build assets with `--no-build`. See the work
order for commands and results.

## Risks

- Marking only the selected task misses unselected/bulk actions.
- Releasing the pending marker too early causes a success-time row flash.
- Filtering archived rows indiscriminately breaks saved archive views.
- A test holding only HTTP responses can miss an early live-event transition.

## Related package and docs

The completed [removal navigation package](../task-removal-navigation/plan.md)
provides the coordinator and remains historical evidence; this adds a new scope.
The archive section in `docs/public/tasks-and-workflows.md` explains pending
archive presentation and recovery. No new ADR is needed:
this reuses the existing local-operation/state ownership boundary.
