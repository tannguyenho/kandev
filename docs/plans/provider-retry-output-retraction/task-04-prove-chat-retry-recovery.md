# Task 04: Prove Chat Retry Recovery

## Summary

Add a controlled mock-agent response-retry sequence and drive it through a real
task session. Prove on desktop and mobile that abandoned assistant and thinking
rows disappear live, remain absent from the durable transcript, and do not
return after reload.

## In scope

- Mock-agent explicit-ID response and thinking emitters.
- Test-only structured response-attempt reset marker and mock ACP dialect.
- Deterministic `/e2e:response-retry` scenario.
- Desktop and mobile task-chat Playwright coverage.
- Existing frontend deletion-barrier unit test.

## Out of scope

- Production provider shortcuts for the mock marker.
- New task-chat markup, responsive composition, copy, or controls.
- Real provider credentials or network calls in tests.

## Acceptance

- The mock scenario exercises the same normalized reset event and durable
  deletion path as the Codex recognizer without making its marker valid for a
  production dialect.
- Desktop and mobile show only the replacement response after the live reset,
  and API readback plus reload contain no abandoned assistant or thinking row.
- The existing message-deletion barrier still prevents a queued update from
  resurrecting a removed row.

## Verification

```bash
(cd apps/backend && go test -race ./cmd/mock-agent ./internal/agentctl/server/adapter/transport/acp -run 'Test.*ResponseRetry')
(cd apps && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec vitest run lib/ws/handlers/messages.test.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project chromium tests/session/provider-response-retry.spec.ts -- --retries=0)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project mobile-chrome tests/session/mobile-provider-response-retry.spec.ts -- --retries=0)
```

## Dependencies

- Task 03 completes the production deletion path exercised by the fixture.

## Risks

- A mock-only marker accepted by another dialect would create a production
  transcript-deletion input.
- E2E assertions that inspect only the DOM can miss a row that returns on
  reload; durable API readback and reload are both required.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- Provider Error Recovery criteria `.26` and `.27`.
- Test strategy in the response-attempt recovery design.
- Existing desktop and mobile transient-retry chat scenarios.
- Existing frontend message-deletion semantic-barrier test.

## Results

Added explicit-ID mock assistant and thinking emitters, a mock-only structured
reset marker, and a deterministic `/e2e:response-retry` scenario. The mock ACP
dialect translates that marker through the same provider-neutral reset path as
Codex while production dialects ignore it. Desktop and mobile Playwright tests
arm causal WebSocket observers before the retry, correlate the provisional row
IDs with their deletion events, require both deletions before replacement, and
verify the replacement-only durable transcript and the same result after
reload. The mock no longer pauses to create a transient DOM assertion window.

Verified with:

```bash
(cd apps/backend && go test -race ./cmd/mock-agent ./internal/agentctl/server/adapter/transport/acp -run 'Test.*ResponseRetry' -count=1)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec vitest run lib/ws/handlers/messages.test.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project chromium tests/session/provider-response-retry.spec.ts -- --retries=0)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project mobile-chrome tests/session/mobile-provider-response-retry.spec.ts -- --retries=0)
```
