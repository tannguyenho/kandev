# Implementation Plan: Attach Workspace Sources

## Overview

Add a durable task-level source attachment contract above the current worktree-only branch flow,
then teach host and remote runtimes to materialize the same source set. Reuse the task-create
repository controls inside a dedicated responsive Files-panel picker, publish live source/root
updates through the existing task/session data flow, and finish with desktop, mobile, Docker, and
SSH coverage. The plan preserves `task_repositories` for Git behavior and introduces a separate
folder attachment relation, as required by
[ADR-2026-07-22-runtime-mutable-task-workspace-sources](../../decisions/2026-07-22-runtime-mutable-task-workspace-sources.md).
The active UX delta extracts the task-create source-mode presentation into a controlled shared
selector, presents **Local** and **Remote** modes inside Add sources, and combines **Add sources**
with **Open workspace folder** in one Files-toolbar action menu without changing the durable source
union or materialization contract.

## Backend

### Persistence and source projection

- Add `TaskWorkspaceFolder` to `apps/backend/internal/task/models/models.go` with task ownership,
  canonical host path, collision-safe display name, global source position, and timestamps.
- Add `task_workspace_folders` to both the base schema and replayable migrations in
  `apps/backend/internal/task/repository/sqlite/base_schema.go` and `base_migrations.go`; enforce
  task/path and task/display-name uniqueness, cascade deletion, and task/position lookup indexes.
- Extend `apps/backend/internal/task/repository/interface.go` and add a focused SQLite repository
  file for folder CRUD plus a transactional batch that creates repository/folder attachments and a
  compensating batch that removes only rows created by the failed operation.
- Extend `Task`, `TaskDTO`, `pkg/api/v1.Task`, boot/snapshot queries, and `task.updated` serialization
  with `workspace_folders`. Build a combined ordered source projection without changing existing
  repository DTOs or Git consumers.
- Allocate positions under the existing per-task mutation lock using the maximum across repository
  and folder rows. Reject runtime-name collisions across both tables after applying the same
  directory-name sanitizer used for multi-repository worktrees.

### Attachment service

- Add `apps/backend/internal/task/service/service_workspace_sources.go` with
  `AttachWorkspaceSources(ctx, request)` and typed repository/folder input/result shapes.
- Validate the whole batch before writes: task exists and is repository-backed; workspace ownership;
  exactly one repository locator; provider-neutral URL and identity consistency; canonical explicit
  local Git paths; canonical arbitrary directories; branches; duplicates; display-name collisions;
  and idle session/turn state.
- Resolve or create repository entities through the existing `ResolveRepositoryRef` path so local
  trust and remote credential rules stay authoritative. Track newly created repository entities for
  rollback without deleting pre-existing workspace repositories.
- Persist the batch, call the runtime materializer synchronously, and compensate database plus owned
  filesystem/runtime entries on failure with a detached bounded context. Publish `task.updated` only
  after both persistence and materialization succeed.
- Refactor `AddBranchToTask` into a compatibility adapter over a one-item repository-source request;
  retain its existing auto-branch naming, duplicate, and slug-collision behavior.

### HTTP, WebSocket, and MCP contracts

- Register `POST /api/v1/tasks/:id/workspace-sources` in
  `apps/backend/internal/task/handlers/task_handlers.go`; define the discriminated source request in
  `task_http_handlers.go`, map typed service errors to `400`/`404`/`409`/`422`, and return the durable
  source projection, effective workspace path, and affected sessions.
- Add `workspace.sources.updated` / `session.workspace_sources_updated` event constants and gateway
  routing in `internal/events/types.go`, `pkg/websocket/actions.go`, and
  `internal/gateway/websocket/task_notifications.go`. Emit only after agentctl has adopted the root.
- Register `add_workspace_sources_kandev` in `internal/mcp/server/server.go` and its backend handler
  in `internal/mcp/handlers/handlers.go`; default `task_id` to the current task and accept the same
  batch union as HTTP. Keep `add_branch_to_task_kandev` externally compatible while routing it
  through the generalized service.

### Host materialization

- Replace the narrow `BranchMaterializer` hook in `internal/task/service/service.go` with a
  `WorkspaceSourceMaterializer` batch interface, retaining a thin compatibility adapter for tests
  and existing call sites.
- Refactor `internal/backendapp/branch_materializer.go` into host source materialization that reuses
  `worktree.Manager` for repository branches and creates a Kandev-owned task root for mixed local
  sources. Link live local sources into that root with platform-native directory links (Unix
  symlinks, Windows directory junctions), while validating the canonical target before and after
  link creation.
- Never copy, move, delete, or write marker files into user-owned local sources. Rollback and task
  cleanup remove only Kandev-owned worktrees, links, and task roots.
- Extend lifecycle workspace rebinding so an idle Local execution can restart/rebind at the mixed
  source root without losing its task conversation; Worktree executions keep their existing live
  sibling materialization path. Persist the promoted `task_environments.workspace_path` for future
  sessions and resets.
- Generalize agentctl rescan from repository-only reconciliation to workspace-source reconciliation:
  update the workdir, rebuild repository trackers for Git entries, refresh file-tree scope for plain
  folders, and fail the attachment if the running agentctl cannot adopt the new root.

### Container and remote materialization

- Add authenticated agentctl endpoints and client methods for validated repository clone/checkout
  materialization under the current workspace root.
- Route local Docker, SSH, and Sprites attachments through their live `AgentExecution` agentctl
  client. Reuse existing executor credential resolution for repository clones; do not persist or log
  tokens or credentialed URLs.
- Reject folder inputs for Docker, SSH, Sprites, and remote Docker during service capability
  validation, before persistence or executor filesystem access. The frontend uses the same executor
  capability to omit the folder source kind.
- Make subsequent launch/reset preparation derive every repository from the durable source
  projection. Remove the task-create frontend guard that forces multi-repository work to Worktree
  only after the corresponding runtime launch paths support repository projection.
- Add the same materializer capability to the remote-Docker interface and tests; the executor remains
  unavailable until its existing `CreateInstance` implementation is completed.

## Frontend

### Shared source picker

- Extract reusable repository selection leaves from
  `task-create-dialog-workspace-repo-chips.tsx`, `task-create-dialog-remote-repo-chip.tsx`,
  `task-create-dialog-remote-repo-chips.tsx`, and `folder-picker.tsx` into
  `components/workspace-source-picker/` without changing the task-create dialog behavior.
- Keep `task-create-dialog-source-mode.tsx` scoped to task creation. Add sources does not reuse its
  segmented mode switch: it presents one **Add repository** menu whose choices append workspace,
  local-Git, or remote rows without changing the visibility of configured rows.
- Add typed mixed rows (`repository`, `remote_repository`, `folder`) and a
  `useWorkspaceSourcePickerState` hook. **Workspace repository** reuses the combined
  saved/discovered repository selector; **Local Git repository** exposes the local path affordance;
  **Remote repository** reuses provider-backed and pasted-URL controls. **Add folder** remains
  adjacent when supported. Appending rows never removes configured rows, so one submission can mix
  source kinds on Local/Worktree. Executor capability removes the folder affordance on
  container/remote tasks.
- Decouple reusable remote-row presentation from create-task-only `DialogFormState`; keep branch,
  provider metadata, discovery, validation, and payload conversion owned by the consuming dialog.
- Add `attachTaskWorkspaceSources` to `lib/api/domains/kanban-api.ts`, source types to
  `lib/types/http.ts` and the kanban slice, and unit-tested payload/error normalization.
- Once backend runtime support lands, delete the non-Worktree multi-repository disable resolver and
  auto-switch effect in `task-create-dialog-computed.ts` and
  `task-create-dialog-multi-repo-guard.ts`; keep the no-repository Worktree restriction.

### Files panel surface and live state

- Replace the separate **Add sources** and **Open workspace folder** toolbar controls with one
  labeled/icon **Workspace actions** trigger in `file-browser-toolbar.tsx`, threaded through
  `file-browser.tsx`, `files-panel.tsx`, `task-files-panel.tsx`, and their hooks. Its dropdown menu
  contains both actions. Keep the trigger enabled whenever opening the workspace folder is valid;
  disable only the **Add sources** row for archived/non-repository tasks, active turns/tool calls,
  or loading source state, and render the reason as visible menu copy.
- Build `components/task/add-workspace-sources/` around the shared picker. Desktop uses a Dialog;
  phone uses a full-height Drawer with fixed header/footer, `min-h-0` internal scrolling,
  `100dvh` sizing, safe-area bottom padding, and a single submit action. Preserve keyboard focus,
  Enter behavior, dismissal, pending state, per-source errors, retryable batch contents, and rows
  configured from every repository or folder kind.
- Coordinate Radix menu close autofocus before opening the controlled Dialog/Drawer so dismissal
  returns focus to the workspace-actions trigger. On phones, use the existing responsive
  `DropdownMenu` bottom-sheet treatment rather than introducing a second action-menu drawer.
- Subscribe to `task.updated` for repository/folder state and
  `session.workspace_sources_updated` for the adopted workspace root. Update the kanban/session
  slices, reset the file-tree cache for affected environment/session IDs, and let existing
  repository/worktree handlers refresh Changes and editor pickers.
- Keep the new phone entry point visible and touch-usable (at least 44px active dimension) without
  hiding any source kind supported by the task's executor. The closest shipped mobile exemplar is
  `components/task/mobile/mobile-picker-sheet.tsx`; reuse its focused picker hierarchy while using a
  full-height surface because mixed rows, branch search, validation, and batch errors can be deep.

### Mobile design contract

- **Desktop outcome:** one compact labeled/icon Files-toolbar trigger opens a dropdown with **Add
  sources** and **Open workspace folder**. Selecting Add sources opens the multi-row dialog and
  refreshes the workspace tree after one atomic submission.
- **Mobile entry point:** the same workspace-actions trigger is visible in the Files toolbar with an
  actual 44px touch target. The shared responsive DropdownMenu becomes a short inset bottom-sheet
  action menu; it does not depend on hover, context click, or desktop Dockview chrome.
- **Hierarchy and primary action:** the action menu chooses between workspace actions. The Add
  sources surface then exposes one **Add repository** control and, when supported, **Add folder**.
  Repository location is a temporary menu choice; configured rows and validation own the single
  scroll body. Cancel and **Add to workspace** stay fixed in the footer, with submit as the sole
  primary action and disabled until a row exists.
- **Presentation rationale:** the two workspace actions are a short temporary choice, so they fit
  the shared inset menu. Source attachment can contain several searchable, branch-aware rows, so it
  continues into a full-height Drawer rather than stacking the full form inside that menu.
- **Shared versus responsive:** source state, validation, payload construction, picker leaves, and
  API calls are shared. Add sources owns its tab-free source-kind menu. Only Dialog/Drawer
  composition, responsive menu treatment, and toolbar hitbox treatment differ.
- **Geometry:** one internal vertical scroll owner, dynamic viewport height, safe-area clearance,
  44px phone triggers/menu rows, contained repository popovers/drawers, and no document horizontal
  overflow.

## E2E Tests

- **Scenario:** GIVEN an idle one-repository worktree task, WHEN a desktop user adds a second local
  repository and a plain folder through **Workspace actions → Add sources**, THEN both
  top-level entries appear and only the repository appears in Changes.
  **File:** `apps/web/e2e/tests/task/add-workspace-sources.spec.ts`.
  **What to verify:** both menu actions, open-folder request routing, the tab-free repository-kind
  menu, mixed-row preservation, dialog flow, atomic success, Files refresh,
  repository-aware UI, and persistence after reload.
- **Scenario:** GIVEN the Files tab on a Pixel 5 viewport, WHEN the user opens the full-height source
  picker through the workspace-actions bottom-sheet menu and attaches two source kinds through the
  responsive repository menu, THEN the same task value is delivered without horizontal overflow.
  **File:** `apps/web/e2e/tests/task/mobile-add-workspace-sources.spec.ts`.
  **What to verify:** 44px trigger/menu rows, both actions, open-folder request routing,
  internal scroll, fixed safe-area footer, submit outcome, dismissal/focus return, and document
  containment.
- **Scenario:** GIVEN a Docker task, WHEN a remote repository is attached, THEN it is readable inside
  the running container; the folder source kind is absent and a forged folder request is rejected.

  remote task directory and survives backend reconnect.
  **File:** `apps/web/e2e/tests/ssh/add-workspace-sources.spec.ts`.
  **What to verify:** remote placement, rescan, persistence, and cleanup ownership.
