# Task 04: Host Materialization

## Acceptance

- Worktree repository additions and mixed Local/Worktree folder sources materialize under a safe
  Kandev-owned task root using live, canonical, platform-native directory links.
- An idle Local execution can re-root/rebind without losing task conversation state; Worktree keeps
  synchronous sibling materialization. Active work is never interrupted.
- Agentctl adopts the new workdir, refreshes file scope and Git trackers, and materialization rolls
  back safely when linking, restart, rescan, or event publication fails.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend
rtk go test ./internal/backendapp/... ./internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/... ./internal/agentctl/server/api/... ./internal/agentctl/server/process/...
```

## Files likely touched

- `apps/backend/internal/backendapp/branch_materializer.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/backendapp/workspace_source_materializer.go` (new)
- `apps/backend/internal/backendapp/*workspace_source_materializer*_test.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/manager_workspace_rescan.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/manager_execution.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/env_preparer_local.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/agentctl/server/api/workspace_rescan.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/agentctl/server/process/manager.go`
- platform-specific link helper/test files under `apps/backend/internal/worktree/`
