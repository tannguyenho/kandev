# Task 05: Remote Materialization

## Acceptance

- Agentctl can atomically clone/checkout a validated repository into a collision-checked workspace
  subdirectory with cancellation and cleanup defenses.
- Docker, SSH, and Sprites use their live agentctl clients and existing credential resolution to
  materialize and rescan repository sources; secrets are absent from logs and metadata.
- Container and remote folder requests are rejected before persistence or filesystem access, and the
  same executor capability is available to the frontend picker.
- New/reset environments rebuild all durable sources, and adapter tests cover failure rollback plus
  the future remote-Docker capability boundary.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend
rtk go test ./internal/agentctl/... ./internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/... ./internal/backendapp/...
```
