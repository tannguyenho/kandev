# Task 09: Public Documentation

## Acceptance

- Public task, coordination, executor, developer-tools, MCP, and feature-status docs explain the Files
  action, supported source kinds, idle-only mutation, executor behavior, Local/Worktree-only folder
  support, and legacy/new MCP tools.
- Statements that multi-repository tasks and post-create additions are Worktree-only are removed or
  replaced only where implementation now proves broader support.
- Security guidance explains that arbitrary folders remain live host grants and are unavailable to
  container/remote tasks.

## Verification

```bash
rtk rg -n "Worktree-only|worktree executor|add_branch_to_task_kandev|multi-repository" docs/public
```
