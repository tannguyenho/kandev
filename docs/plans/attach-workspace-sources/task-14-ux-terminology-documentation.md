# Task 14: UX terminology documentation

## Acceptance

- Public docs direct users through **Files → Workspace actions → Add sources** and describe the
  tab-free **Add repository** menu rather than the removed Local/Remote modes.
- Documentation preserves executor capability, branch, atomicity, and folder limitations without
  implying a backend contract change.
- Feature-status and cross-linked coordination/developer-tool descriptions use the same concise
  terminology.

## Verification

```bash
rtk rg -n "Files → Add sources|saved workspace repository, a local Git repository, a remote Git repository" \
  docs/public
make docs-check
rtk git diff --check
```

## Files likely touched

- `docs/public/feature-status.md`
- `docs/public/tasks-and-workflows.md`
- `docs/public/coordination.md`
- `docs/public/developer-tools.md`

## Dependencies

Tasks 11 and 12.

## Inputs

- Spec: **What**, **Scenarios**, and unchanged executor/failure contracts.
- Plan: UX delta overview and Files/source-selector sections.

## Output contract

- Update only this task file to `in_progress` when starting and `done` after acceptance and
  verification pass.
- Return a compact handoff capsule with files changed, terminology decisions, command results,
  risks, and any uncertainty.
- Do not update `plan.md`; the planner serializes shared-plan status.
