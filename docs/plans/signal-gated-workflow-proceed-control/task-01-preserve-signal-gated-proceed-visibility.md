# Task 01: Preserve Signal-Gated Proceed Visibility

## Summary

Carry the existing signal-gated workflow-step flag into task UI state and use it
to distinguish a truly automatic `move_to_next` transition from a signal-gated
one. Prove the adjacent-step composer action stays available after the gated
agent becomes idle while unsupported gated destinations remain hidden. Keep the
action hidden in both composer surfaces while a clarification barrier is active.

## Inputs

- `docs/specs/tasks/requirements/workflow-explicit-completion-signal.md`
- `docs/specs/tasks/system-design/workflow-signal-gated-manual-move-visibility.md`
- `docs/decisions/0015-explicit-completion-signal-for-auto-advance.md`
- `apps/web/hooks/domains/kanban/use-plan-actions.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/state/slices/kanban/types.ts`
- Existing HTTP, snapshot, workspace-switch, and WebSocket workflow-step
  mappers.

## TDD sequence

1. **RED:** Add hook cases showing that a gated `on_turn_complete` `move_to_next`
   action should expose `proceedStepName` while the equivalent ungated move,
   gated `move_to_previous`, and gated `move_to_step` stay hidden. Add coverage
   that an omitted flag keeps the legacy ungated behavior.
2. **RED:** Add mapping assertions for initial hydration, multi-workflow
   snapshot refresh, mobile workspace switching, and workflow-step WebSocket
   updates. Confirm they fail because the flag is absent from `KanbanState` or
   dropped by each mapper.
3. **RED:** Add the focused Playwright scenario and confirm the next-step
   locator remains hidden after the mock agent returns idle.
4. **RED:** Add shared composer eligibility coverage and deferred-hydration
   rendering cases for standard and passthrough surfaces when
   `WAITING_FOR_INPUT` has a durable pending clarification.
5. **GREEN:** Add the optional step field, preserve it through each mapper and
   the Go boot-state mapper, and narrow the automatic-transition suppression
   condition in `useNextWorkflowStep`. Apply one shared composer eligibility
   policy from chat types to standard chat and passthrough surfaces, using both
   the durable session projection and message-derived fallback.
6. **REFACTOR:** Keep workflow projection in the shared hook and keep the
   busy-state and clarification gates in one shared UI policy. Do not duplicate
   them in mobile components.
7. Run the focused unit, type, lint, desktop E2E, and mobile parity commands.

## Acceptance

- An idle signal-gated step with a configured `move_to_next` action exposes the
  existing adjacent-next-step composer action.
- The equivalent ungated step does not expose a redundant action.
- Signal-gated `move_to_previous` and `move_to_step` actions remain hidden
  because the existing composer action submits the adjacent next step.
- A busy agent still hides the action until it becomes idle.
- A pending clarification hides the action while the session is
  `WAITING_FOR_INPUT`, including while messages are hydrating; clearing the
  durable and message-derived barrier makes it eligible again when idle.
- Initial load, cached snapshot refresh, mobile workspace switching, and live
  workflow-step updates preserve identical behavior.
- Selecting the action uses the existing manual task-move endpoint and advances
  to the configured next step.
- No `step_complete_kandev` signal, `manual_fallback` source, new metric, or new
  user-facing copy is introduced.

## Dependencies

None.

## Risks

- Missing one state projection creates load-order-dependent visibility.
- A loose boolean default could turn older payloads into gated steps.
- Changing the display components could accidentally weaken the active-turn
  guard; they should remain consumers of the shared derived value.
- Reading only `isAgentBusy` would treat `WAITING_FOR_INPUT` as eligible even
  while a durable clarification is pending; both composer surfaces must use the
  shared pending-clarification gate and retain the message-derived fallback.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Output contract

Record the RED failures, changed mapper paths, focused verification results,
and the final desktop and mobile E2E counts. Update this file to `done` and the
plan work-order checkbox to `completed` only after all acceptance criteria pass.

## Implementation evidence

- RED unit run: six focused files failed only on the missing signal-gated field
  and the resulting hidden proceed action. The RED desktop browser run failed
  because `proceed-next-step` was absent after the mock agent became idle.
- Changed projections: SSR hydration, multi-workflow snapshot refresh, mobile
  workspace switching, workflow-step WebSocket updates, and live Kanban update
  payloads now preserve `auto_advance_requires_signal`.
- GREEN unit run: 7 files, 84 tests passed.
- Typecheck passed.
- Focused ESLint passed with no errors; it reported four existing complexity or
  file-size warnings.
- Desktop browser regression passed: 1 test.
- Mobile task-drawer parity regression passed: 1 test.
- Specification tests passed: 36 tests. Full specification lint passed. Diff
  check passed.
- PR fixup remediation: the shared policy now exposes only gated
  `move_to_next`; gated `move_to_previous` and `move_to_step` remain hidden,
  and omitted flags remain ungated. The Go boot-state mapper now preserves the
  field for direct task-page hydration. The browser regression waits for the
  task API to report the target step before asserting the UI.
- Replacement PR remediation: both composer surfaces hide the signal-gated
  proceed action during an active clarification barrier and restore eligibility
  after it clears. The shared predicates now live in `chat/types.ts`, and the
  durable session projection covers the message hydration window. Focused
  coverage includes standard and passthrough rendering in `WAITING_FOR_INPUT`
  with a pending clarification.
- Replacement PR verification: 10 frontend test files, 145 tests passed;
  typecheck passed; specification tests (36) and full specification lint passed;
  diff check passed. Disposable desktop and mobile clarification captures each
  passed one browser test and were removed before commit.
