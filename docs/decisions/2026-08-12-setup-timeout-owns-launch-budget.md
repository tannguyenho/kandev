# ADR-2026-08-12-setup-timeout-owns-launch-budget: One Setup Timeout Owns Launch Budgets

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-12
**Area:** backend

## Context

Session creation used an independent one-minute deadline for a shared execution.
Repository setup could legally run for five minutes, and some remote prepare
paths already allowed ten minutes. A setup that crossed one minute therefore
finished under its own limit but passed an expired context to runtime creation.
The resulting `agentctl not ready: context deadline exceeded` error blamed the
wrong stage.

Operators need one temporary configuration control while the product has
several setup-script implementations. Independent public setup and launch
values could recreate the same invalid ordering.

## Decision

`apps/backend/internal/common/constants` owns one process-start timeout policy.
`KANDEV_TASK_PREPARATION_TIMEOUT` sets the preparation-script limit and defaults
to 10 minutes. The parser accepts positive values supported by
`time.ParseDuration`. Missing, invalid, zero, and negative values use the
default.

All repository and executor prepare paths use that setup value. The internal
agent-launch limit is derived as the setup value plus a fixed five-minute
allowance. Shared execution creation does not start that timer while resolving
the environment. Each runtime launch phase starts a fresh derived deadline,
while the preparation script receives a separate setup context.

The environment variable is the only new public setting. No compatibility
alias is needed because this setting has not shipped. Cleanup limits and
runtime-specific fatal or non-fatal setup behavior do not change.

## Consequences

- A setup script can use its documented budget without earlier uploads,
  environment resolution, or runtime preparation consuming it.
- One operator value keeps setup and launch limits in a valid order.
- The default launch-phase limit is 15 minutes. A truly blocked launch phase
  therefore takes longer to fail than it did under the accidental one-minute
  limit.
- The fixed five-minute allowance is internal. A future product setting may
  replace this temporary environment-only contract.
- Invalid values fall back safely, but the fallback does not stop backend
  startup.

## Alternatives Considered

### Configure setup and launch separately

Rejected because an operator could set the launch value below the setup value
and restore the original failure.

### Raise only the shared launch deadline

Rejected because setup limits would remain inconsistent across repository,
local, Docker, Sprite, and SSH paths.

### Remove launch-phase deadlines

Rejected because a blocked runtime phase could hold the activity lease forever.

### Add YAML or Settings UI configuration now

Deferred. One startup environment variable fixes the reported failure with a
small public surface.
