# ADR-2026-09-14-durable-queue-admission-receipts: Durable queue admission receipts

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-14
**Area:** protocol

## Context

Ordinary queue submissions lack server replay protection. Queue rows can merge or disappear before a client receives their admission response.
Plan-comment rows have special replay handling and intentionally avoid automatic merging. Applying that exception to every prompt changes existing merge behavior.

## Decision

The fix stores an admission receipt atomically with each identified ordinary admission.
The receipt binds the request fingerprint and accepted response to the task, session incarnation, and client queue ID.
It survives queue operations until the owning task or session is deleted. Stale incarnation checks still reject old requests.

Receipt identity is separate from queue-row identity. Ordinary admission provenance is stored in a merge-ignored metadata key and unioned when rows fold, so retries can reconcile transcript messages after dispatch. Retries consult the receipt before repeating capacity checks or attachment claims.
The client enables ordinary retries only after the server supplies this contract.

## Consequences

Lost responses no longer require an existing queue row or transcript message to prevent duplicate admission.
The repository needs additive schema initialization, database parity, and lifecycle cleanup coverage.
Receipt storage grows with accepted submissions in retained sessions. Response snapshots must not copy inline attachment bytes.
Task and session purge transactions remove the associated receipts with the queue state. The accepted implementation package applies this decision.

## Alternatives Considered

- A longer timeout reduces failures but does not settle lost responses.
- Searching queue and transcript alone leaves gaps during dispatch and after removal or merging.
- Reusing the plan-comment path disables ordinary automatic merging and requires nonexistent comment references.
- An in-memory receipt loses replay protection after restart.
